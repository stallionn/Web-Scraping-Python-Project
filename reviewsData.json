And the room is delightful -- not fancy, but handsome and the tables are not on top of one another.  Best of all, it's one of the few places I know of where one can still have a quiet conversation with one's companions. Highly recommend.",

This is a quiet, civil atmosphere great for conversation and savoring the good food.  The roasted duck was wonderful as was the mushroom soup starter.  Good service, warm welcome, a charming Greenwich Village restaurant.",

There are always an array of daily specials, every one proving to have been a wise choice.  The wine list is solid and appropriately priced.  The restaurant is comfortable, congenial, and attractively designed.  The sound level allows conversation with your table mates to be pleasant, without needing to cup your ear to hear each other.

However, when we arrived, we were told that our reservation was for only the brunch, but that we had not indicated on our reservation that we intended it for the jazz brunch.  We were not the only people to have this problem. There were at least four parties that we could see who also were denied entrance to the jazz brunch and were quite angry and disappointed.  This was not the first time we were at Four Square for the jazz brunch and it had never been an issue before.  The maitre d'  was very decent and comped our breakfast but overall it was a disappointing day because we had been looking forward to the jazz brunch for a few weeks. It is absolutely crucial that Four Square make much more clear the requirement on their website that one has to specifically indicate that the reservation is for the jazz brunch, and not simply for the brunch itself.",

Salmon was delicious but one side was just slightly overcooked. Friend had steak, very good. We shared arugula salad, was delicious. Desserts are a highlight (we had key lime pie and strawberry rhubarb crisp). Very attentive waiter.",

The food is consistently good, it is reasonably priced and we could always count on it for an enjoyable dinner out.  However, the last few times we have been here, there has been a noticeable issue with service.  At our last visit, we were seated for 20 minutes before anyone came over and asked about drinks or food order (and this was only after my husband went up to the bar to inquire).  Two women sitting by us had a similar experience, albeit an even longer time without service.  This has happened a few times now and at first we attributed it to newer staff post COVID but enough time has passed for adequate training.  The food remains reliable so we will give it a few more chances but I  do hope that management can improve the service with either new or additional staffing.  It's a solid neighborhood place so it would be a shame if we had to stop dining here.",

The menu is modest, but offers a very good selection of meals. It is obviously  manageable for the restaurant. The result is that the food offerings are consistently outstanding -- every dish is fresh, plentiful, and nicely presented. The service is quite good. It is a great value for very good food. We have frequented the restaurant a lot and we have never been disappointed.",

Now I see other restaurants copying this creation. I love his lamb burger with homemade pickles, his calamari with its special tangy sauce, his eggs McDougal with spinach and smoked salmon, his caesar kale salad with mini croustades serving as croutons...I could go on.

Even my bowl was tiny. We had to pay for bread too. I've been going to this restaurant for years and always enjoyed the food.",

And, the noise level is so low that you can actually sit and have a conversation, which is why I try to eat here as often as possible.  Dessert was particularly good this time--an exceptional chocolate mousse thing.",

Returned a voice mail restaurant left on my voice mail a few hours before reservation & told them I would try to arrive early for my 9:30 reservation because it was last seating .  I did a walking tour of the west village that ended at 9 & literally ran the 5 blocks in the rain to make it for 9:15.  I passed 30 beautiful eateries on my way to north square but I wanted to keep my reservation .  Upon arrival I was asked to seat in the lounge ., which I said yes.  When being shown to a table a very nasty women approached us and declared the kitchen was closed & had been since 9.  I asked why did you accept a 9:30 reservation & then confirm it a few hours ago \u2026.I got silence.  It almost ruined a very nice date night.  As it was very dirty I chalked it up\nTo being for the best.   I ate at 8th street wine cellar which was perfect .",

We declined that and asked to eat outside at a proper sized booth on the Waverly Place side - only to be told it was closed, despite otherwise occupied booths.  Then, they brought us inside, past an empty main dining room, to a booth next to the restrooms and waiters station.  We decided not to walk out - but did ask to turn down the lighting, which we did.  \n\nI was so embarrassed to get the bums rush here - we have been going there for years - maybe they don\u2019t like four guys eating there.

At 7:00 happy hour was still under way. Too lively and not the experience we wished for them.  Our guests arrived first and were already seated and had their drinks and at that point trying to move would have been awkward. Service slow but friendly. Late in the evening a loud man who clearly had too much to drink overpowered the room and embarrassed us with his vulgar ranting. On speaking to management they said they\u2019d address it but seemed reluctant as he was a regular. We skipped after dinner drinks and left. Thankfully the food was quite good.",

Food is reasonably priced for its outstanding quality. Some familiar dishes and several more  (Most recently we had Tuna Tartare, Mushroom Ravioli, Vegetable and Sausage Tangine, and Coriander Tuna; all excellent). \nAmbiance: It's quiet enough for easy conversation, which is like a miracle in NYC. There's music that's truly in the background. Comfortable, not flashy, amazing flowers.\nService: Friendly, Attentive, informed.",

It was as advertised: elegant,  quiet and I was warmly greeted and seated. The waiter seemed a little unfocused but when my friends and I ordered drinks and appetizers,  we knew what we wanted for entrees and went ahead with our order. \nThe oysters and polenta sticks arrived looking delicious and we were about to indulge when our entrees were set down as well. We were at a smaller table in the bar so it was a tight fit. We could have sent them back but I hate to waste food and I try to be polite. So we managed. However, I did speak to the Maitre 'D on the way out. \nOther than that, everything was lovely and I would return. But not to that waiter.",

First of all the service starting at the entrance door and continuing through to dessert and coffee are always are friendly, top notch.  The wait staff, likewise, is friendly, helpful, and really offer a big assist helping the customers pick out their main course - i.e., something that you will like and something you believe will amount to a delicious dinner at a value price.\nThe food itself is very good, whether meat, fish, pasta.  The dinner plate sizes are just right and are roomy enough to provide for a tasty, very good meal at a decent price.     \nThere's no rushing the customer at North Square.  Waiters and other staff are clearly on the lookout to remove plates when customers finish each course, but they're not hovering over each customer to see them finish a course.\nBesides offering a variety of meals at decent prices,  the restaurant is busy but yet quiet enough to have pleasant across-the-table conversation.  For me, the restaurant offers the right mix of food and ambiance - and that's what most of us are looking for when having a pleasant dinner with friends or colleagues\nGive this place a try and you may well become a repeat customer too, like me.",

The main course seafood entrees were poor (soggy SOFT-SHELL CRABS also served atop hummus with a few whole chickpeas and SCALLOPS, both served with an unidentifiable seasoning that smothered all below).  The duck breast was the only entree at our table worthy of praise. The best was yet to come....KEY LIME PIE. There was a rowdy group of diners at the adjacent booth and the waitress was abrupt. Unfortunately, we are not likely to try this restaurant again.",

In fact, you could be in \"Anywhere, USA\".  But don't let the decor put you off. \n\nI've eaten there a few times and the food is always excellent.  2 of us had arctic char, which was prepared perfectly: moist, with a crunch skin.  One person at the table orders duck wherever she goes, and she couldn't say enough about how delicious it was there.  The birthday boy had rack of lamb, which he had eaten there many times before, and he loved it.  Someone else had salmon, and she likes it almost completely raw.  She complains constantly at restaurants that it isn't rare enough, but they got it right.  The servers are attentive to requests and they don't get it wrong.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the noise level is low and everyone can hear everyone else.  I'm tired of straining my voice in restaurants.  I suppose the noise level at so many NYC restaurants  is supposed to give it a festive mood, but I strain my voice enough in my work; I don't like to fight ambient noise when I'm eating.  I'm young, but 2 members of our party were older, and noisy restaurants just don't work for them.  The volume at this place is perfect.\n\nObviously, it's not a secret in the neighborhood.  The place appears to have a lot of loyal locals, many of whom look liked they've lived in the area for a long time.  I suppose there are some people from the hotel that houses the restaurant.  But, mostly, it seemed to be people like us who wanted to eat a delicious dinner, celebrate a birthday (there was another birthday at a table nearby) and enjoy the company of their friends/family without all the noise.\n\nWe are becoming regulars.",

We were staying at the Washington Square Hotel and needed someplace close for dinner, but were worried because sometimes hotels don't have the best eateries . We noticed right away that everyone who came in was a local and appeared to eat there regularly, and we saw why. The crab and corn salad was perfectly seasoned and very fresh. The rack of lamb with its dusting of parsley/mint/herbs, which were finely grated, was a divine flavor combination. Since I always order my meat medium rare, I was super happy to find a chef who REALLY knows how to do that properly (perfectly pink inside, crusty on the outside and hot all the way through!) The AuGratin potato accompaniment was also beautifully prepared with delicate, yet amazing flavor. Lastly, the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was prepared with roasted coconut- unexpected and delicious!! We will definitely eat here again!",

I assume it was because it was evident from our accents that we were not locals. When we asked for a different table, we were told all the other tables were reserved for their regular patrons. After refusing the offered table, in the completely empty room, we were grudgingly given the next table to it. the food was indifferent, and we have enjoyed much better for less cost, in central Manhattan.",

And the food superb with a large menu offering many choices. The prices may not be \"old Village\" but what is? It has kept the same look and atmosphere for decades and the same high standards. Every time an old friend and I come here, we say, \"Thank goodness for North Square, may it endure\" while around us the streets have given way to tacky shops, chain stores and restaurants that will be gone overnight.",

We did not think we would have room for dessert but went ahead and ordered 3 different items to share.  When our original waitress returned she asked us what we had ordered and was disappointed that we hadn't ordered the key lime pie.  So we did and that turned out to be the best choice.   We will definitely be back!",

This was a brunch to celebrate birthday and we were a party of 6 plus a one year old. All of us were welcomed and with the exception of a slow start by the server, the meal was great. They offer a $20 \"sampler\" brunch that includes a mimosa, coffee and a selection of eggs, pancakes, very tasty sausage, french fries etc. Happy to recommend.",

Service was friendly and the staff accommodated out requests when possible.\n\nThe decor is a little dated but well maintained, we sat at the upper level but another room where they play live music is available downstairs.\n\nUnfortunately the food was not impressive. Very basic presentation and bland taste, I would say diner level. Prices are ok with the quality of the food.\n\nAll in all it was ok, definitely not in line with past reviews and 4.5 star rating. Will need to be more careful next time!",

Both entrees were tasty, perfectly, prepared, and plated nicely. In fact, the lamb was so good that I almost forgot my table manners :)\n\nWe rarely (never) get dessert, and our waitress surprised us with their signature key lime pie.

Many years ago, someone snatched it up, cleared it out and made it a little NYC gem, a stellar boutique hotel that includes this delightful dining spot, North Square.  It's a place where normal people eat. And that doesn't mean \"old\" or \"out of touch.\"  Just people who love good food, don't read their e-mails while dining, respond to the warmth and knowledge of its waitstaff, the lovely wine list,  un-shocking prices--and just damned good food, superbly prepared and served on time.  I have brought several people from out of town here who request that we return when they visit again. And you don't have to call 30 days in advance for a reservation. A true little treasure just across from Washington Square Park which, despite greedy developers, remains intact and beautiful. If you're after a completely lovely evening, here it is.",

It's NYC and the truth is, there are a lot of upscale great restaurants. Great, welcoming service is harder to find, in my opinion.

We topped off dinner with dessert; I had the key lime pie and it too was splendid.  We also had two excellent sauterne dessert wines, and very much enjoyed such a sweet end to our fantastic evening at North Square.  We highly recommend this neighborhood gem.",

Although it was restaurant week, we decided  to order from the regular menu.  For an appetizer, I had the scallops risotto, which was one of the specials for the night and my friend had a crab meat salad.  Both were delicious.  For the main course, I had the breast of duck, which was prepared medium, just as I requested.  My friend had the fish special which was moist and not overcooked as  has happened on occasion in other restaurants.  We were very pleased with the main courses.  For desert, we ordered the platter of cookies which was a nice assortment of chocolate and other flavors.  It was more than enough for two but so good we finished all of them.  We also ordered a bottle of the French Bordeaux (2010 vintage) that was offered as a special for restaurant week  even though one of us was having fish.  We both enjoyed it so much that we hope to be able to find a place where we can buy it for home use.  All in all a fantastic evening.   We look forward to returning to North Square soon!",

        "Review": "Nicely done for first week of restaurant week.  Unlike some other restuarants this one puts THREE separate menus in place, one for each week.  We went for the first of the three, which was the least quirky menu, with mostly winter comfort foods on the list.  Nicely limited menu, with just the right kind of variety.  The appetizer of gnocchi with a variety of flavorings was really a sort of Asian-Mexican-American Fusion dish.  The New England Clam Chowder was a leek and potato based soup, rather than an overly cream-based-artery clogger.  The broth contain a number of large plump clams, which inspires the kid in your brain with treasure hunt anticipation.  Pork rib-eye was perfectly done comfort food, with one outstanding quality.  This was the most tender perfectly cooked pork chop I've ever eaten, and I've had a few.  Another stand out, the coffee Cr\u00e8me Brule was the most generous such desert size I've yet seen.  This is especially nice for sharing.  The pricing for restaurant week wasn't an outrageous bargain; essentially you get the desert for free.  But on the plus side, at $3.00 a cup, this restaurant also doesn't rip you off for $5.00 for a cup of tea or coffee, as many do. \n\nThe crowd was an odd mix of aging dowagers, just barely doddering into their seats, left-over Village hippie era retirees, who likely live in the area and won't give up their Brownstones until they are dead, maybe even not then (their kids will inherit them), and a few youngish loved-up couples on a romantic date.  \n\nService was attentive and pleasant, just right, despite the place being busy on a Thursday night.  The flow was impressive.  Tables would empty and fill right up again, so the reservation scheduling was clearly seamless and well done - and required if you want to get a table on a busy evening.",

Rox Corral brings an ever changing and world class jazz ensemble to this quaint Village restaurant each Sunday.  Aside from the top flight music talent, the kitchen turns out some tasty brunch cuisine.  Starting with the assorted bread basket, I'd highly recommend the brunch pre fixe, with an assortment of sweet and savory items to please any diner.  Service was excellent and very attentive.  North Square is a must visit for any serious lover of good food and jazz on a Sunday.",

This time, we were very disappointed, from the moment we came in (with a reservation). Noticing many tables that would be able to accommodate the two of us (not encroaching on fours), we were rudely told we had to take the seats in the fron by the door. The server was friendly, helpful and accommodating, but the dinner (Duck Breast ) lacked flavor  and was not up to their usual standard. We propably will not return and will not recommend the restaurant to friends.",

It was very distracting and rude to the singer.    If they wanted to talk why didn't they sit in the restaurant room as opposed to the lounge.  North Square did nothing to encourage the table to listen to the music.The lounge only has 10 tables which should make for an excellent and intimate jazz brunch.

I had the Brunch Tasting (Baby Pumpkin Pecan Pancakes, Two Scrambled Eggs, Chicken & Apple Sausage, Home Fries). The pancakes were excellent, the sausage was just beautiful.

Wanted a nice, new place in that neighborhood that we'd never been to. Didn't realize it was attached to a hotel, and it also seemed like a hotel restaurant when you walked in. In fact, it smelled like hotel breakfast (coffee, etc). No one other than us was under the age of 65 on a weeknight. No complaints about the service. The food was just okay. Crostini's missed the mark...none of the flavor profiles really went together and duck confit was poor quality. Tuna tartare was okay, but I didn't like the combination of all the diced raw veggies in it. The fish quality was good, though. For mains, the duck was okay, but had an over-fried spring roll and random black beans on top. My date had the lamb which was pretty good. I don't want to dog the restaurant, it wasn't bad, but it was just small and hotel-ish and the food was not outstanding. I think if I knew that going in, I would have had different expectations.  There's all these mentions of jazz nights there...no idea where they have the room to play jazz music.",

There still is modest music coming from a speaker and the close tables contribute, but it was fine.\n\nThe service was great - not intrusive but keeping tabs on us.  The food was wonderful - we did a prix fixe and both ordered different items which were very good.\n\nI ordered the soft shell crab, cod and bread pudding - and enjoyed all of them.  To be honest, can't remember what my son ordered, but he loved the cheesecake.\n\nBeforehand, waiting for him, I sat at the bar - and talked to the bartender who was incredibly knowledgeable about the seasonal beers and new drinks people were ordering.\n\nOverall, a wonderful evening and we'll be back.",

        "Review": "We opted for a late lunch and had a window seat with a few other tables finishing their meals when we arrived. Our first impression was not all that positive. First of all, the hostess needs a personality. She half heartedly, and without so much as a smile, offered seating options in a wide open dining room. My companion was taking a phone call in the vestibule and while there had to assist elderly patrons to exit the restaurant. All the while the hostess looked on without lifting a finger or afterwards so much as offering a thank you for assisting.  Fortunately the dining experience improved. Our waiter was generally attentive, courteous and efficient. We had the crab cakes, a pork porterhouse sandwich and a duck confit salad and two glasses of wine. What I loved was the fresh ingredients and the mostly salad and veggie accompaniments vs. French fries, rice, and potatoes. The crab cakes were particularly notable but could be improve with a bit of citrus based accompaniment, even a bit more of the existing accompaniment would have improved what was a good choice. The Duck Confit salad was also good but the duck bits were a bit flat in flavor and changing this would make an otherwise good salad into a great salad. The pork sandwich was perhaps the disappointment of the meal as it sounded great on paper but was a bit lackluster in flavor. I am not sure if it is a function of the need to appeal to a wide range of palates why some of the flavors were so muted or if it was a function of our seating being close to the end of the lunch service. Getting our check seemed to be a deer in headlights inspiring experience for the staff member whom we had to draw away from some screen at the hostess station; she seemed visibly annoyed at having to do anything for the restaurant\u2019s guests. Finally we virtually showed ourselves out without a departing thank you while the staff congregated in the rear.",

We had the address listed as 103 Waverly place which is a hotel so we assumed it was the entrance and the concierge directed us through the corridors. We noticed once in the restaurant that the entrance to the restaurant is on McDougal, around the corner from Waverly Place.\nThe atmosphere was cozy. Our waiter gave us a choice of table and we enjoyed a nice dinner.\nFor appetizer we had fried calamari with a small side of slightly spicy tomato sauce which was good. For entree we had roasted duck and grilled red snapper over a bed of vegetables. Both entrees were delicious. They had several desserts from which we chose a chocolate mousse with dark chocolate ice cream ball equally delicious.\nThrough the dinner the service was very good.\nThe decor is art deco like, very nice.\nI will certainly recommend this place to anybody looking for good dinner a reasonable price in a nice environment.",

My friends all had oysters (I can't comment, but they seemed happy) and then a few apps.  I know the tuna tartare was delicious.  My mushroom ravioli thing was fine, although I was jealous of the tuna app, and regretted not having ordered the butter/radicchio salad w/cheese that I had considered, once I tasted that.  Several of us had the steak, which was tender and buttery, and for me that more than made up for the excess of pepper in my first bite.  But I'm not a huge pepper fan, and I much preferred the mustard that came on the side  (and the big fat steak fries were just the way I like them).   My friend was very happy with her duck entree and we shared some desserts but I was so full at that point I only had a bite or two.   We were all full but the desserts were finished.   Oh, the Sancerre by the glass was excellent.  Not inexpensive overall ($300 for 5 including 2 bottles of wine, before tip),  but a great location and WONDERFUL service.  Definitely recommend.",

If all you want is to be seen with your own precious little demographic, there are plenty of other places that will accommodate you until you age out yourselves.",

The restaurant was practically empty yet, we were offered two tables right next to other people. When I asked for the empty booth in the back, I was told it was specifically requested and reserved by other people.\n\nThe woman at the table next to us was very loud and talked the entire time, even while eating her food. Since the \"booth\" and many other tables were still empty one plus hour after we had arrived, I discreetly asked to be seated for the dessert course at a different table.\n\nAgain, the hostess claimed they were fully booked and offered me a table in the noisy lounge next door.  We declined. The waiter was amazing though and a short time later, quietly came over and poured me more wine gratis.\n\nBy the time we left the booth I had requested had JUST been seated but, the booth next to it had been empty for at least 45 minutes. Several tables at the restaurant had NEVER been filled and remained empty.\n\nCustomer service and satisfaction is clearly not a priority!!!!!",

On the one hand you have very attractive people welcoming you on the other hand i could not work out who was managing the place.\nThe food was probably better than the 3 stars but we all suffered from salt overdose later and were all drinking water like mad.\nChefs should realise that 1990s methods of flavouring have moved on and salt should be on the table not in the food.\nWe were well served but it was very stilted. If I was the owner I would be worried about the loose canons being left to their own devices.\nI felt they were more busy doing things than caring for us.\nIn short a clunky heavy handed experience but the quality of the food was good marred only by the saltiness .",

Although this option is no longer on the menu all you need to do is ask. As a result our group has always had an excellent, well-priced meal of exactly what we want to eat.",

The food came out on time and we made new friends in the crowd. Although there was no dance floor we stood up and danced to our requested song \"At last\" & everyone enjoyed themselves.

It isn't cheap but equivalent to others in the area of its kind. These service was odd - we never got a waiter so finally had to ask the hostess. It seemed they were reluctant to serve us an we had different people come to the table at different times. It took a very long time overall.",

The rack of lamb was perfectly seasoned, pink inside, just as it should be. Potato galette was also perfect: full of flavor, not heavy of fatty. My dining companion had the short ribs -- absolutely no fat (not easy with short ribs), in a richly flavored sauce with ancho chili and other mysterious flavors -- cinnamon? Delicious.\nBest of all: it's quiet! You can hear whoever is on the other side of the table and have a conversation. Music is muted classic jazz, staff is friendly, relaxed and efficient.",

The food was wonderful and so is the decor of the restaurant. But overall, the service needed improvement. What made the afternoon worse was the insensitivity of the waitstaff. No one came over to explain the delays. After everyone was finally served, I politely mentioned it to the server, who offered a defensive explanation but nothing more. Not good for business!",

They did fix that, but when checking my bank account the next day I was not only charged for half the bill I shared with my partner, but also I was double charged for the whole bill. We also wondered where our waitress went because at the end of night, the bus boy was taking care of us. Let's just say we will not be returning here again.",

The man at check in gave me a semi lecture about making a special call ahead to reserve as they had so many reservations. Really? I thought that was the purpose of the \"notes\" section. In any event, the brunch was tasty as always. I love the bread basket with the cranberry nut bread and other assorted goodies. My omelette was cooked to order with a delicious salad.

However when we were to be seated, we were directed out the front door and up the street to the Washington Square Hotel entrance, through the lobby and into the old-fashioned, dark-panelled barroom! Quite a strange set-up. My husband loved it, me less so. But the food was very good with many options besides turkey, plus we had comfortable seats and plenty of room. At $55 prix fix for appetizer, entree, dessert and coffee, a very good value.",

The duck got raves, my son loved his pork ribeye, and my scallops were perfectly cooked. The crab and lobster cakes were a perfect first course, and both desserts (chocolate mousse cake, spicy bread pudding) were eagerly devoured. And the bread here is always great. Plus they have a fine list of wines by the glass and pour generously. When my husband admitted that he didn't love his cocktail, the waiter immediately asked what would make it better and brought a new version (which he did indeed like better). As always in North Square the service was very pleasant but a little slow.",

North Square has been there it seems for\ndecades and yet seems to remain a neighborhood secret. The ambience is calm and seemingly unchanging, The tables are a little to close .The back room has a Jazz brunch in Sunday .The\" tasting dish\"on the brunch menu is quite good and as almost everything on the menu it remains one of the best bargains in NYC.\nAlthough the serving size is not large, it always seems to be just enough to satisfy. I would like to see a few more items offered on the dinner menu, it's a little to limited for me. Following your meal walk literally across the street and you have beautified Washington Sq. Park.",

People who'd been seated before us still had their menus. Others, who arrived after we did, left without ordering. Once our order was finally placed, there was another wait, but a variety of delicious breads and mini-muffins helped quell the hunger pangs. When our entrees finally arrived, the food was nicely presented, delicious (both meals) and reasonably priced. I blame the owner or manger or whoever didn't ensure proper staffing for the busy Saturday lunch crowd, not our valiant server. I hope it was an anomaly. I'd definitely give it another chance based on the food alone.",

Food, service, and ambience make it one of the most comfortable restaurants in New York. A group of 4 can actually have a conversation while eating - the noise level is pleasantly under control. On our most recent visit (9/6/13), low noise level and very attentive staff made us comfortable as always.. However the food seemed less fresh, less well-prepared and served compared to earlier visits. Perhaps it was the chef's night off, but the food (including the wine and the desserts) were just \"off\". For example the Arctic Char tasted fishy rather than fresh, and the dessert rather bland. We will certainly return, expecting better food.",

So when we asked, the jazz area was already full - which absolutely sucked because that's the reason why we wanted to eat there. So make sure somewhere on Opentable you tell them you want the jazz brunch, or like me, you'll miss out. Sad. But the food was good and very reasonably priced.",

Entrees also took too long to arrive, and the meal itself was uneven: kale salad with apples and buttermilk dressing was plentiful and delicious, the duck breast was succulent, the sauteed halibut was dry and flavorless and the vegetable accompaniments were brown and blandly prepared. The place is pretty, tables are well-spaced, but I doubt we'll be going back.",

Our table was tucked into a corner (which we liked), but it was nearly impossible to get the attention of a waiter, or busboy... or anyone, for that matter. The vibe was one of casual indifference. North Square lacked a soul -- there was no staff member that seemed happy enough to be serving diners, or really be bothered with any of the aspects of running a restaurant. It is a shame, since the location is great, the food is decent, and the ambience is pleasant.

Just very good, traditional, but not old fashioned cuisine. Many items from which to choose: tuna, steak, lamb. We were too full to try the creme brulee or apple crumble.

She was sitting at a table downstairs; she had been told that she was the first to arrive and had been given a table downstairs. The women who made this mistake were unapologetic. This is the second time such a thing has happened to me; once they put my companion in the back room and me in the front, and it took half an hour before he came out to see if perhaps they had messed things up.

But it was slightly disappointing this time. My omelet was dry and relatively tasteless, the potatoes were cold and dried out. The service was spotty (eggs arrived very quickly, but coffee seemed to take forever). Also, I really dislike it when wait staff comes over to clear too early and asks \"...still working on that\" ?? Working on it? Hardly an elegant way of describing what is supposed to be a leisurely dining experience. So, on the whole, not what I've come to expect of this lovely little place, but they probably just had a bad day.",

Delicious.)\n-The shrimp appetizer.\n-Scallop and Salmon Terrine ~~[[This was actually given as compliments of the house. Thanks!]]\n-The rhubarb and strawberry crumble\n\nWine...

The omelets were over-cooked, the salad had wilted from the heat lamps (or something) and the home-fries were tasteless. I should have sent it all back. I was hoping for a nice, perfect omelet, based on my previous experience at North Square, but no. The bread was good, but I would guess, left over from dinner the night before.

We go to a lot of similar events (Brooklyn Brewery does them often) and this event was shockingly awful. Completely disorganized; made people who were paying $65 per plate wait, as the event started a half hour late, without providing any drinks. The seating arrangement, once we were sitting, was such that I was elbowed in the head every 20 minutes by a waiter. There were about 45 minutes between each of the courses. What's better than waiting forever for food that is less than mediocre? Then there's the decor/ambience --- the odd IHOP-like lighting, the no music, the cramped seating. There was nothing positive about the experience here.",

I'm sorry to rate my visit as poor - it wasn't the waiter's fault and the bartender did comp drinks for us - but I hope in the future - while realizing they want to accommodate everyone - that they don't have huge parties in the music room. Our food was served almost an hour and a half after the start of our reservation. The party goers had no sense of decorum, running around and showing each other things on their laptops and basically ruining the whole experience for us. All that being said, I do look forward to returning at a quieter time.",

After we were seated, we waited quite some time for our server to take drink orders. When I asked if there were any specialty cocktails, she disappeared for another long stretch, came back with a cocktail list and vanished again. When we finally got to order, we learned that one of our drinks (a very standard order) could not be made as the bar had run out of stock. Our server, while pleasant enough, seemed unfamiliar with the menu and rather bewildered in general. That said, I would try North Square again on a non-holiday in the hope that the service might compare to the food",

She offered us a small table by the main door, but we politely declined. We told her we were willing to wait for a nice table. She rudely responded by saying we would have to wait a LONG time for a table. She appeared unable to think calmly, and it was clear she wanted to get rid of us in order to focus on someone else. She then offered us a table in the bar section. My girlfriend and I said we would take a look and decide. So she then rudely called to one of her staff, \"Go show them this table!\" She had no manners at all.",

My prix-fixe omelet was fluffy but somewhat bland; bloody mary nicely seasoned but lacking kick. Delicious coffee; dark-roast, strong, piping hot. The bread basket is worth breaking your carb fast, but it only seemed to be offered with the a la carte food -- we had to request one. Female waiter was a bit hearty; didn't seem to have the polish I remembered and expected from visits in the past.",

The crab and pear salad is one of my all-time favorite salads, and the tuna tartare is the best version I've had of this over-made dish. I've never had a bad meal there, and on top of everything else, they have an excellent (and changing) list of wines by the glass, and serve the best basket of bread around. One more bonus: for some reason, the restaurant draws an older, quieter crowd, which means that you can actually have an audible conversation there over lunch.",

Tasty lobster and crab cakes were followed by seared scallops -- only four but huge -- which were absolutely delicious. The spicy pumpkin creme brulee for dessert was the best creme brulee I've ever had. Friendly wait staff. It was very busy on a Saturday night but the noise level was never too high. You may have to wave down your waiter to get a saecond drink or glass of wine, but they are otherwise pretty attentive and you'll get that drink or wine rather quickly. All in all, very nice!",

There wasn't any flavor and the scallops I had were as tough as shoe leather. The ambiance was not for quiet conversation because I could hardly hear across the table. This seemed to be a neighborhood spot that was for much elderly customers and wasn't a place for anyone who was under the age of fourty, unless your an old soul. The service was very slow and the wine list was just as disappointing.",

I was sadly disappointed. The waiter bought out the wrong appetizer, our water glasses were empty for most of the meal, and the check was miscalculated and additional charges were on the bill. They have many senior citizen regulars and the food is not bad. But the service was terrible especially when I specifically made it known that this was a very special occasion. Would I go again? Perhaps. But not for a special occasion.",

The location, combined with either a longer table or a longer booth made it difficult for us to hear each other speak. The apple/cauliflower soup was ok but not very flavorful, and the snapper was decent. The key lime pie was good, although it didn't seem unique. My girlfriend's chicken dish was much better than the snapper, and her banana cake was solid as well. All in all, though, I wouldn't recommend the food on the restaurant week menu, although this week's dishes look much better than what we had.

The menu (Thanksgiving dinner) was varied and all four diners were very pleased with their three course dinners. The wine list was varied and deep, although not totally up-to-date as the wine ordered ('06) was presented with a younger vintage ('07). Why don't restaurants use updatable tablets (e.g., ipads) so that wine lists are always up-to-date?",

The staff is attentive and pleasant neither  aggressive nor obsequious.  The menu changes seasonally but some favorites are always available.   There are not an excessive number of choices but good and broad representation.   We love the place.  Even had our Anniversary party/dinner here.

Service was a little spotty, but the food was very good. Fillet mignon, shrimp bisque and chopped salad got rave reviews. Scallops, char and duck were good. The decor needs to be freshened up. The big floral bouquet in the room is a nice idea, but it look a bit tired when we were there; was it red carnations?\nNext time I'll know to ask for a cozy spot in one of the banquettes along the wall.",

Waiter also didn't feel the need to write down our order (it was the only intellectual stimulation he got in his day, he told us) but the wrong salad appeared initially for one of our party, so perhaps he brain wasn't quite up to the workout...",

The yellowfin tuna entree and the ravioli were great. The service was good as well. My only concerns were with the decor and temperature of the restuarnt. The decor looked like a typical old Italian restaurant in NJ that needed a major update (only thing missing was the plastic plants). There were at least 3 different kinds of wallpaper and very eighties style pictures. Despite the outside temperature being about 50 degrees the restaurant pumped out the AC at max and several guests were wearing their winter jackets at the dinner tables-this should never happen!I would not return despite the food.",

The menu was quite appealing, with extensive offerings and an interesting way of offering the standard dishes but then offering the same food a la carte with sides so that diners can mix and match their sides with their mains. Everything was well presented, and the fish dishes we all ordered were well cooked, but, unfortunately, the flavors were not as appealing as I'd hoped. My spinach salad with mushrooms just didn't taste that good, and the side of spinach I ordered with the halibut wasn't flavorful. Desserts were quite good, particularly the chocolate mousse with caramel and Heath bar bits. Would return if someone else wanted to go, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to go again.",

It seemed as if the menu was just a little bit out of their league. Any flavors they tried to instill were not developed enough. The halibut and short ribs were underwhelming and boring. The horseradish mashed potatoes did not say horserasish at all. And the best part of the meal was the side of cauliflower mash. Plus the room felt like it should have been dressed up more.

The dessert choices were delicious- we shared a lime-coconut flan and chocolate mousse cake. I'd opt for the flan as a lighter, less dense choice. My only criticism was it was so cold in the dining room, I wanted to wear my jacket! The lounge was warmer- opt to eat in the lounge, it has more spunk and personality.",

Small, quiet, they always have great bistro standards (a very nice roast chicken), and a good wine list.  Gorgeous flowers, too. It's in a (very small) hotel right on Washington Square.  Your fellow diners will sometimes be hotel guests:  very quiet, some alone. Not a 'destination' restaurant, but good for when you want a simple meal, and happen to be in the nabe. Get a booth.",

I used Open Table to schedule a brunch with friends.  The hostess was most friendly.  The waiter largely ignored us - barely refilling beverages, and only after multiple requests.  I was actually embarrassed by the quality of the food.  The french toast was a soggy mess of bread.  The pumpkin pancakes were hardly palatable. The fruit salad, home fries, and bacon were good.

This is the first time I've gone with my whole family (including two picky young-adult eaters), and everyone had a great meal.  And the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food.  The kitchen is sometimes a little slow, but the service is very attentive.  The average age of the diners in the evening is quite a bit higher than at lunch, but I think that indicates that wisdom grows with age and it means that the restaurant is actually quiet enough for a meaningful conversation.",

North Square met all those requirements.  I thank Open Table reviews for helping me find this great restaurant that we will definately return to.

The decor is not a draw for us, but we hear it is going to be renovated.  Nonetheless, the atmosphere is casually elegant.

When I read that the restaurant offered a \"Jazz Brunch\" I thought it was worth a trek into the city to check it out.  I was disappointed to find that we couldn't hear the music from our table, and the band wasn't playing in the restaurant- they were playing elsewhere(probably in the hotel lobby or bar), and to add insult to injury- our server took our order then disappeared.  She only returned when I had paid the check- she said \"thank you\" and walked away.",

Chopped salad was a wonderful variety of veggies with just a hint of dressing to enhance rather than overpower the salad.  Filet was cooked to perfection with a divine, bread was served with our own carafe of olive oil, free range chicken was tender  moist and well-done",

The polenta on the dish and the sauce was outstanding.  Duck empanada and shrimp skewer appetizers was also very delicious.  Filet mignon entree was also very good.",

THis should be prohibited if it wants to be a cut above the rest.\nYou see one thing (informal attire on patrons & staff) but get another (excellent service & food).\nIt is a tale of two restaurants but I wish they would choose the more formal.",

The fish however, although small, was delicious.",

I only mention those two selections because I love them but my husband and friends who dine with me will equally defend their choices as vehemently.\nThe meal is that special!\nI only wish that the service were a bit more attentive. One gets the feeling that the policy is more about just bringing food to table and then becoming scarce. No one really comes back to inquire about particular needs.\nYou must be a bit aggressive to get a server to come over for desert , more coffee, or to bring check.\nThis, however is a minor criticism given how spectacular the dining experience is.\nI highly recommend  North Square every chance I get.",
