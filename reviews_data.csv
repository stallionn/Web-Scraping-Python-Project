North Square
Review,Rating,Date
"North Square is a treasure.  The food is excellent.  The service is cordial and attentive.  And the room is delightful -- not fancy, but handsome and the tables are not on top of one another.  Best of all, it's one of the few places I know of where one can still have a quiet conversation with one's companions. Highly recommend.",4,Dined 1 day ago
Had dinner with friends while staying overnight at the hotel and are so glad we did.  Service was terrific and our food choices were enjoyed by all of us… delicious mushroom soup I might add.  We were delighted when a dish of cookies was delivered for us to celebrate 2 birthdays.,5,Dined 5 days ago

"What a lovely neighborhood restaurant near Washington Square Park.  Though it has a loyal following (nearly every table was taken when we dined there this evening).  This is a quiet, civil atmosphere great for conversation and savoring the good food.  The roasted duck was wonderful as was the mushroom soup starter.  Good service, warm welcome, a charming Greenwich Village restaurant.",5,"Dined on November 22, 2024"
"Tasty, pleasant jewel loved by locals and savvy travelers",4,"Dined on November 21, 2024"
each time I’ve done there. The food has been quite nice. Not superb but quite tasty. Pricing is competitive and the atmosphere is very comfortable. Service could be a little more enthusiastic.,4,"Dined on November 19, 2024"
You can't beat the ambience inside as well as the location of the restaurant across from Washington Square Park. The service is impeccable. The regulars appear to be long-time locals and everyone is very friendly.  There is a lovely understated upscale quality to the place. The brunch is more than adequate but does not rate the top star. I live in Brooklyn but it is my go to place every chance I get.,5,"Dined on November 17, 2024"
All good. Will go back. Nice quiet restaurant attached to Washington Square Hotel.,4,"Dined on November 17, 2024"

The Sunday Jazz brunch is a wonderful event.  Food is fine and the performers are first rate.,5,"Dined on October 20, 2024"
"Four of us started with happy hour followed by dinner. Very pleasant service. Food was solid. We got calamari, quesadilla, sirloin steak, duck, and a halibut special. Everyone liked everything - in particular, the steak was tender and the duck was better than you get in most restaurants. Prices were very moderate, especially wine from the happy hour menu. While not ultra gourmet, a solid place for a good meal. And happily, it wasn’t too noisy. You won’t be disappointed.",4,"Dined on October 19, 2024"

"I love North Square, especially the lounge and the staff. It’s the place I return to over and over again.",5,"Dined on June 11, 2024"
"The lounge area for dining is quite nice, cozy, and an attractive room. There were very few diners this particular evening in the lounge, so the sound level was quiet. But, there were several people at the bar area that had loud voices and that made the noise level very different ... until they left...then much more quiet. The main dining room is also quite nice, but on this particular evening the door was open and the warm air wafting in made the temperature too warm for my comfort. Both rooms are lovely.",5,"Dined on June 2, 2024"
"We made a reservation for breakfast at 10:30 and on the confirmation it said 10:30-12;00 we were aware we were going for breakfast not brunch and  we placed our order as soon as we sat  down . We finished our breakfast at 11;am and asked for coffee but were told the kitchen was closed . We were aware that we had to leave by noon but how long does it take to drink a coffee?  People around us were still sitting and having coffee . It ruined our breakfast , we love north square and eat there all the time but this left a unpleasant taste in our mouths after a delicious breakfast",2,"Dined on May 19, 2024"
"North Square has declined in quality. The restaurant is drab, the service mediocre at best, the food is good but not great.",3,"Dined on May 17, 2024"
"A lovely, homey restaurant with good food at a fair value.  They have a nice staff, as well.",5,"Dined on May 13, 2024"
"Lunch at North Square is always enjoyable. We particularly enjoy dishes that take advantage of seasonal vegetables and fresh herbs. Would love to see a daily omelette added to the lunch menu! We had anticipated a quiet meal since we came fairly early, but a large group of 10-12 folks took a nearby table so with music piped in it was unusually noisy. With warm weather coming, sitting outdoors instead may be on the menu!",4,"Dined on May 9, 2024"

Love this place.  Favorite in the Village.  Down to earth and good conversations.,5,"Dined on April 25, 2024"
"North Square offers an intimate jazz band setting with a fabulous brunch on Sundays. For $25 per person you get a perfectly portioned brunch, a cocktail, coffee plus over an hour of outstanding live jazz! With only 12 tables and some bar seating, there is not a bad seat in the place.  A true New York gem just steps away from Washington Square Park. Bring some cash to tip the band!",5,"Dined on April 21, 2024"

"It is one of the great mysteries of NYC why this restaurant isn't more popular.  But then again, maybe I should be careful what I wish for.  I have been to North Square 5 times in the past year, and it delivered very, very good food, especially for the price, at each visit.  There are always an array of daily specials, every one proving to have been a wise choice.  The wine list is solid and appropriately priced.  The restaurant is comfortable, congenial, and attractively designed.  The sound level allows conversation with your table mates to be pleasant, without needing to cup your ear to hear each other.  The food is delicious,  expertly prepared, and confidently served by the congenial waitstaff.  If you haven't tried it, you owe it to yourself to give it a try.",4,"Dined on February 26, 2024"
"We were visiting from Vancouver Canada and this was our last day. We decided to try and find some jazz and, since it was Sunday, looked for a jazz brunch. 
The music was great, the musicians were welcoming and friendly, and the dining experience was also so good. 
The prices were incredibly fair for the value of the experience. 
Thank you!",5,"Dined on February 18, 2024"
"We had hoped to be there for the jazz brunch. However, when we arrived, we were told that our reservation was for only the brunch, but that we had not indicated on our reservation that we intended it for the jazz brunch.  We were not the only people to have this problem. There were at least four parties that we could see who also were denied entrance to the jazz brunch and were quite angry and disappointed.  This was not the first time we were at Four Square for the jazz brunch and it had never been an issue before.  The maitre d'  was very decent and comped our breakfast but overall it was a disappointing day because we had been looking forward to the jazz brunch for a few weeks. It is absolutely crucial that Four Square make much more clear the requirement on their website that one has to specifically indicate that the reservation is for the jazz brunch, and not simply for the brunch itself.",1,"Dined on February 18, 2024"
"Tasty food, good value and excellent service--all good!",4,"Dined on February 16, 2024"
"Food was good, very good.  We came for the Restaurant Week Prix Fixe lunch that was indicated on Open Table for $30 per person.  They did not offer that, only the dinner price at $45 per person.  An unpleasant surprise.",4,"Dined on January 23, 2024"

"We went to North Square to celebrate a special birthday in a low key way. All of the staff were warm and attentive. The menu was varied and the food was very tasty. The chef's special dessert of pear spice cake with caramel sauce was the perfect balance of sweet, fall spices, and caramel.",5,"Dined on December 29, 2023"

We had a wonderful dining experience as we always do at North Square !  The food was so delicious and well presented and the service was excellent !!,5,"Dined on December 19, 2023"
"We asked for a quiet booth and got one, for which we were grateful even though it was right next to the door leading to the restrooms. All of the staff was friendly and attentive except for one waitress, who seemed put out by any request or question. But the main point is that the food was excellent and creative, from calamari to pumpkin cheesecake. All of the entrees were perfect. The only real complaint might be that the bartender doesn't know how to make a Manhattan, at least not a traditional one with bourbon and sweet vermouth. Rather than trying to rectify the order the above-mentioned waitress argued with us.",5,"Dined on December 17, 2023"
"Very nicely prepared food. Really good job on the Halibut, which is hard to accomplish with such a dry fish!",5,"Dined on December 6, 2023"

A perfect place to meet my grandson who is a freshman at NYU. We had an uninterrupted lunch with excellent service and very good food. It was quiet enough so that we could catch up with his life and talk. We were there for 3 hours!,4,"Dined on November 19, 2023"
"I am thoroughly embarrassed that I brought an important contact to this restaurant for a first impression!  Do NOT repeat my mistake!!

North Square used to be synonymous for impeccable service, scrumptious dining, and a quiet, understated intimation of something special.  

All of those tangibles and intangibles were absent during yesterday’s lunch.  

The staff were moping about, the food ill-prepared, and frankly the place felt and looked tired and grimy. 

There are too many good and great restaurants in the area that value my cash to return to North Square, ever.

Learn from my mistake and go elsewhere.",1,"Dined on November 16, 2023"
Wonderful lunch at North Square. The kale and apple salad was fresh and delicious. The vegan Thai cure was terrific. And the pear tart was just sensational. Excellent service and reasonable prices. Will definitely return.,5,"Dined on November 2, 2023"
"Went to North Square for their Jazz Brunch on Sunday, which was excellent all around.  Marty Elkins and her group were amazing as was the Brunch itself.  The restaurant space is cozy , but the tables are spaced well.  I ordered the Brunch Tasting, which included Pumpkin Pecan Pancakes, Two Scrambled Eggs, Chicken & Apple Sausage (or Apple Wood Smoked Bacon) Roasted Yukon Potato & Asparagus....BIG yum!  Very reasonable place as well!  The staff was excellent and really took good care of us!  Thanks, North Square!",5,"Dined on October 1, 2023"

Took a couple of tries but staff finally gave me my preferred table (I am a picky Goldilocks). Standard prices for the neighborhood. Appealing menu. Salmon was delicious but one side was just slightly overcooked. Friend had steak, very good. We shared arugula salad, was delicious.

"North Square has been a favorite neighborhood spot for several years.  The food is consistently good, it is reasonably priced and we could always count on it for an enjoyable dinner out.  However, the last few times we have been here, there has been a noticeable issue with service.  At our last visit, we were seated for 20 minutes before anyone came over and asked about drinks or food order (and this was only after my husband went up to the bar to inquire).  Two women sitting by us had a similar experience, albeit an even longer time without service.  This has happened a few times now and at first we attributed it to newer staff post COVID but enough time has passed for adequate training.  The food remains reliable so we will give it a few more chances but I  do hope that management can improve the service with either new or additional staffing.  It's a solid neighborhood place so it would be a shame if we had to stop dining here.",4,"Dined on March 19, 2023"

"Hello
This is the first time I have eaten in North Square  in many years.   I was pleased with the brightness, roominess and great comfort.  Unfortunately the dessert was a disaster, being old.  it was stale and we were quite sad on this reality.

A real bonus were the prices which were extremely reasonable, especially these days where it seems all the restaurants in NYC have become unaffordable.

The menu is modest, but offers a very good selection of meals. It is obviously  manageable for the restaurant.

We have frequented the restaurant a lot and we have never been disappointed.",5,"Dined on April 20, 2022"

It was delicious and paired perfectly with plantains, broccoli rob and a light fruit infused sauce. The other special that I tried was also delicious – – German chocolate cake complete with pralines and caramel sauce. All the regular items such as herbed rack of lamb and endive salad with blue cheese, pear and lardons  were delicious. I highly recommend this all time winner!

The harvest salad with crunchy breadcrumbs sprinkled atop roasted vegetables on a bed of  deliciously and delicately dressed greens--was a first to me Thanksgiving 2020. Now I see other restaurants copying this creation. I love his lamb burger with homemade pickles, his calamari with its special tangy sauce, his eggs McDougal with spinach and smoked salmon, his caesar kale salad with mini croustades serving as croutons...I could go on. Suffice to say Chef Yoel's special touch makes North Square a must for dining in the Big Apple.",4,"Dined on November 26, 2021"

The restaurant was supposed to be on Restaurant Week (from July 19 to Aug. 20, but we were told that it was only on for two weeks and that time was over. Our service was exceedingly slow, and we had to ask the servers to speed it up several times. The halibut we both ordered was a decent piece of fish but it had no sauce and was very dry on the palate. It was accompanied by a puny disc of some grain with a couple of peas thrown in. 
A poor meal indeed at a price that was over valued. Never again will I make the mistake of eating there.",1,"Dined on August 2, 2021"
The salad was skimpy. It was like a side dish.  The endive salad is usually my favorite and I was very disappointed this time. I had maybe 2-3 tiny pieces of blue cheese. Even my bowl was tiny.

Returned a voice mail restaurant left on my voice mail a few hours before reservation & told them I would try to arrive early for my 9:30 reservation because it was last seating .  I did a walking tour of the west village that ended at 9 & literally ran the 5 blocks in the rain to make it for 9:15.  I passed 30 beautiful eateries on my way to north square but I wanted to keep my reservation .  Upon arrival I was asked to seat in the lounge ., which I said yes.  When being shown to a table a very nasty women approached us and declared the kitchen was closed & had been since 9.  I asked why did you accept a 9:30 reservation & then confirm it a few hours ago ….I got silence.  It almost ruined a very nice date night.  As it was very dirty I chalked it up

Then, they brought us inside, past an empty main dining room, to a booth next to the restrooms and waiters station.  We decided not to walk out - but did ask to turn down the lighting, which we did.

The little Art Deco rooms outside were perfect for my 90 year old aunt who wants to eat out but gets cold eating outside. We felt perfectly sAfe and warm sitting outside in our own little cabana with heater. The Thanksgiving selections were festive and appropriately autumnal. I chose a harvest salad appetizer with roasted delicata squash and a venison entree with creamy polenta and root vegetables. Both of our desserts were good to the last bite and had beautiful flaky crusts. Will return for sure!,5,"Dined on November 27, 2020"

Our guests arrived first and were already seated and had their drinks and at that point trying to move would have been awkward. Service slow but friendly. Late in the evening a loud man who clearly had too much to drink overpowered the room and embarrassed us with his vulgar ranting. On speaking to management they said they’d address it but seemed reluctant as he was a regular. We skipped after dinner drinks and left. Thankfully the food was quite good.",3,"Dined on April 5, 2019"
Always a pleasure.,5,"Dined on March 31, 2019"
"Wonderful place. Enjoy going for the food, ambiance, and quiet atmosphere. This visit, however, I had an unpleasant experience with the highly untrained and definitely not ready for prime time hostess.

"Hadn’t been to North Square in a few months and while the food was still quite good, the menu has changed. There were fewer appetizers and some of our old favorites are gone. We dined in the bar area and it seems like the traditional bar food menu was also minimized. I think they changed the drink glasses too, since the drinks don’t hit the brims as in the past. 
It’s still a great restaurant but after 15 plus years, our old favorite has changed.",4,"Dined on March 24, 2019"

"Haven't been here in a couple of years and the makeover is nice, however the lack of tablecloths isn't.  Putting cutlery down on a bare table wiped with a dirty rag is not pleasant. It's unsanitary.    It also adds to the noise level, as tablecloths help to soak up sound.  I wouldn't mind if there was butcher block paper on top of the cloths.  Bring back table cloths please!",4,"Dined on March 8, 2019"

My husband had the chicken, which he really enjoyed, my son had the duck, that he said was excellent, and I had the salmon, which was great.  The highlight was the pumpkin creme brulee.

Menus appeared as soon as our drink order was taken and the day only got better with scrumptious, flavor packed shrimp risotto, and other tasty warm morsels. I can hardly wait to go back.

A friend recommended North Square as a good place to eat where one could actually converse without strain (rare in the Village). It was as advertised: elegant,  quiet and I was warmly greeted and seated. The waiter seemed a little unfocused but when my friends and I ordered drinks and appetizers,  we knew what we wanted for entrees and went ahead with our order. 
The oysters and polenta sticks arrived looking delicious and we were about to indulge when our entrees were set down as well. We were at a smaller table in the bar so it was a tight fit. We could have sent them back but I hate to waste food and I try to be polite. So we managed. However, I did speak to the Maitre 'D on the way out. 
Other than that, everything was lovely and I would return. But not to that waiter.",5,"Dined on October 12, 2018"

"North Square is one of very few Manhattan restaurants that I return to.  I've never had anything but good experiences there, and ditto my guests.  First of all the service starting at the entrance door and continuing through to dessert and coffee are always are friendly, top notch.  The wait staff, likewise, is friendly, helpful, and really offer a big assist helping the customers pick out their main course - i.e., something that you will like and something you believe will amount to a delicious dinner at a value price.
The food itself is very good, whether meat, fish, pasta.  The dinner plate sizes are just right and are roomy enough to provide for a tasty, very good meal at a decent price.     
There's no rushing the customer at North Square.  Waiters and other staff are clearly on the lookout to remove plates when customers finish each course, but they're not hovering over each customer to see them finish a course.
Besides offering a variety of meals at decent prices,  the restaurant is busy but yet quiet enough to have pleasant across-the-table conversation.  For me, the restaurant offers the right mix of food and ambiance - and that's what most of us are looking for when having a pleasant dinner with friends or colleagues

"After two bad experiences, I wrote a review here and asked North Square to contact me for details. And they did! Priscilla called me and was fantastic. She listened and apologized and promised my next visit would be better - and free of charge! She did not disappoint! She and our waiter could not have been more generous and professional. The only reason I’m not assigning a top score is because it took three tries to get the kale salad the way I’d ordered it - no cheese and no onions :) But the waiter apologized over and over and over, so it didn’t affect our overall experience, which was terrific. Can’t wait to go back, very soon! Thanks, North Square!",4,"Dined on March 4, 2018"

"First, the decor can be a little off-putting, because nothing about it says ""heart of the West Village"" or conveys the history of Washington Square Park, where it's located.  In fact, you could be in ""Anywhere, USA"".  But don't let the decor put you off. 

I've eaten there a few times and the food is always excellent.  2 of us had arctic char, which was prepared perfectly: moist, with a crunch skin.  One person at the table orders duck wherever she goes, and she couldn't say enough about how delicious it was there.  The birthday boy had rack of lamb, which he had eaten there many times before, and he loved it.  Someone else had salmon, and she likes it almost completely raw.  She complains constantly at restaurants that it isn't rare enough, but they got it right.  The servers are attentive to requests and they don't get it wrong.

Perhaps most importantly, the noise level is low and everyone can hear everyone else.  I'm tired of straining my voice in restaurants.  I suppose the noise level at so many NYC restaurants  is supposed to give it a festive mood, but I strain my voice enough in my work; I don't like to fight ambient noise when I'm eating.  I'm young, but 2 members of our party were older, and noisy restaurants just don't work for them.  The volume at this place is perfect.

Obviously, it's not a secret in the neighborhood.  The place appears to have a lot of loyal locals, many of whom look liked they've lived in the area for a long time.  I suppose there are some people from the hotel that houses the restaurant.  But, mostly, it seemed to be people like us who wanted to eat a delicious dinner, celebrate a birthday (there was another birthday at a table nearby) and enjoy the company of their friends/family without all the noise.

We are becoming regulars.",5,"Dined on June 10, 2017"

She seemed distracted all night and not attentive to our table. Unfortunately we will not be back,3,"Dined on June 4, 2017"
"Nice restaurant in the corner of Washington Square
The food and service were very good.
It has very nice art deco paintings",4,"Dined on June 1, 2017"
"Bottom Line up-front: We like North Square a lot and have come here for years. Years.

However, this particular occasion, it felt different. Maybe it was the loud-talkers (very unusual for this place) across the center aisle. Or the boisterous babies (also unusual). But also, the casual formality seemed to be missing, which was a little sad. But, we'll be back. Oh yes, we'll be back.",4,"Dined on May 31, 2017"
"Fine, straight-forward meal. Out of first choice wine, but a modest local product was good. Well intentioned service; all good for a quiet night.",4,"Dined on May 30, 2017"
Service even better than the food. Accomdared our super late arrival for brunch. We came back with another friend for Happy Hour. Great service John serving and unamed bartender for drinks and personality.,5,"Dined on May 29, 2017"
"North Square is, in my opinion of course, the best restaurant in the Village.  It is quiet, pretty and the food is always good.   The service is also always friendly and efficient.   I love this restaurant and have never had a bad meal there.",5,"Dined on May 28, 2017"
"My friends and I have enjoyed North Square's charms before. While we were disappointed to discover the bar was closed for an event and so no happy hour, the manager and staff were nice and accommodating to our every need. One of our party was an hour late and we talked hours longer than planned. Instead of making us feel rushed we were treated like family. Excellent food and the soup is always a treat. My friend loved her wine as well. Even not on a holiday weekend we hope to come again and not overstay our time. Thank you again!",5,"Dined on May 27, 2017"
North Square is a go to place for a lovely neighborhood dinner as well as a comfortable happy hour in the bar area.,4,"Dined on May 23, 2017"
"Great jazz brunch!  Servers very nice but needed a little tightening up. Not busy but waited at the door, were not sitting in the room with the music as requested by phone, dirty dishes not cleared for 25 mins etc.  All of that said, food music and atmosphere are great and it's a good value for the price.",4,"Dined on May 21, 2017"
"This was a great find for us. We were able to have a leisurely brunch with friends, we never felt rushed be cause they needed the table. The food was delicious and the drinks were just perfect  (with plenty to chose) for a Sunday afternoon.",5,"Dined on May 21, 2017"
"The restaurant was very comfortable and the food was nicely prepared and fairly priced. I was a little surprised that the server knew nothing about wine and disappointed that she had to be asked to get someone who did. And strangely, she also couldn't answer a question about one of the desserts coherently.
But all in all, we had a very pleasant evening.",4,"Dined on May 20, 2017"

"Went for Mother's Day, admittedly a busy day for restaurants. That said,  service was not good, even with a low bar. Had to ask for coffee multiple times, when I got it and asked for milk, the waiter came back and poured some milk right into my coffee. Had the tasting plate, scrambled eggs were liquid. I would have sent them back, but no one ever showed up again. On the positive side, the pumpkin pancakes were very good.",3,"Dined on May 14, 2017"

"Always a pleasure. We were greeted warmly, like old friends, and the exeperience from the start was terrific. We have been here 3-4 times before and the food and care have always been superb. The wine list is wide and interesting, and priced fairly. The endive salad was a treat and the tuna tartare appetizer was heavenly. My pork ribeye was tender, not dry and a real taste. My dessert, a tarte tatin, was worthy of a repeat. I just couldn't eat any more. Price was reasonable and we will, of course, head back there again...soon.",5,"Dined on May 13, 2017"
Very good quiet restaurant on Washington Square. There were at least half a dozen items on the menu that I wanted to order.,4,"Dined on May 10, 2017"
"I love North Square! And now, so do four of our friends who went with us for lunch on May 11. As always, fresh flowers greet you. Lovely staff. Great food. Five of us had salads and all were great and not overwhelming in size - sometimes, less is best - and another friend opted for the veggie option which she loved. Good desserts too. The restaurant is very comfortable and I have recommended it to many of the years.
Thank you North Square!",5,"Dined on May 10, 2017"

"This restaurant was quite a delight! We were staying at the Washington Square Hotel and needed someplace close for dinner, but were worried because sometimes hotels don't have the best eateries . We noticed right away that everyone who came in was a local and appeared to eat there regularly, and we saw why. The crab and corn salad was perfectly seasoned and very fresh. The rack of lamb with its dusting of parsley/mint/herbs, which were finely grated, was a divine flavor combination. Since I always order my meat medium rare, I was super happy to find a chef who REALLY knows how to do that properly (perfectly pink inside, crusty on the outside and hot all the way through!) The AuGratin potato accompaniment was also beautifully prepared with delicate, yet amazing flavor. Lastly, the creme brûlée was prepared with roasted coconut- unexpected and delicious!! We will definitely eat here again!",5,"Dined on April 23, 2017"

"This was my first time back for dinner in years to an old favorite.  The food was wonderful-creative and not too heavy, service was attentive without hovering, staff were welcoming and friendly.  I appreciated the comfortable banquette seating and the possibility of having quiet, private conversation.  We were there a long time and only ordered an entree (not even alcohol), but the staff treated us like valued customers they'd like to have back.  I'll be returning soon!",5,"Dined on April 4, 2017"
"Service was very poor. We were made to feel like out of town rubes. We had an early reservation. When we arrived, although the dining room was empty, we were taken to the worst table in the room, right next to the front entrance and the till. I assume it was because it was evident from our accents that we were not locals. When we asked for a different table, we were told all the other tables were reserved for their regular patrons. After refusing the offered table, in the completely empty room, we were grudgingly given the next table to it. the food was indifferent, and we have enjoyed much better for less cost, in central Manhattan.",1,"Dined on April 3, 2017"
"Wonderful experience.  I wanted  a good meal with modest noise level so I could enjoy my conversation with old friends. North square was perfect for that. Food was excellent. The server was knowledgeable about all aspects of the menu, from wine to food to describing in detail all the teas available.",5,"Dined on April 2, 2017"
"Always very good, never disappoints. One of my favorite local places",4,"Dined on April 2, 2017"
North Square is an old favorite on Washington Square Park near NYU. The food is truly first rate - better than what you expect from what is really a neighborhood restaurant not a destination. Service is good. The ambience is cosy. There is a nice bar in the back. They can accommodate larger groups but the place is really for twos and fours. I will be back!,4,"Dined on March 31, 2017"
"We celebrated my  niece's birthday, and the staff was aware of this, and catered to her.  As a result, we had a special after-dinner drink and a candle on our shared dessert.  Very friendly staff from the moment we walked in.  Looking forward to going back!",5,"Dined on March 31, 2017"

"This meal was good however the fish was somewhat undercooked in  a way that made it very unappetizing. Overall the meal was not as good as usual, typically it is excellent .  The location where  we were seated, between other tables made it difficult to hear and have a conversation when the restaurant was somewhat full.",4,"Dined on March 11, 2017"

Village, where quiet jazz plays on the speakers, where people come to talk and can actually hear each other, where we're surrounded by art, and attended to by caring staff. And the food superb with a large menu offering many choices. The prices may not be ""old Village"" but what is? It has kept the same look and atmosphere for decades and the same high standards.

Desserts likewise were good, not outstanding.  Neighboring tables were too noisy, but they departed about 1/2 hour after we ordered.

"We were in town to see a show at NYU and needed a place close by.  I chose North Square strictly because of it's proximity.  My husband and I and another couple were immediately impressed with the ambience.  The waitress was very personable and at our request recommended her favorites on the menu - which we went with and loved!  The portions were large, delicious and very filling.  We did not think we would have room for dessert but went ahead and ordered 3 different items to share.  When our original waitress returned she asked us what we had ordered and was disappointed that we hadn't ordered the key lime pie.  So we did and that turned out to be the best choice.   We will definitely be back!",5,"Dined on October 17, 2016"
"This charming restaurant is just off of Washington Square Park. We had the benefit of a beautiful fall day to add to the experience.  This was a brunch to celebrate birthday and we were a party of 6 plus a one year old. All of us were welcomed and with the exception of a slow start by the server, the meal was great. They offer a $20 ""sampler"" brunch that includes a mimosa, coffee and a selection of eggs, pancakes, very tasty sausage, french fries etc. Happy to recommend.",4,"Dined on October 16, 2016"
"I had brunch with a couple of friends and their kids. Service was friendly and the staff accommodated out requests when possible.

The decor is a little dated but well maintained, we sat at the upper level but another room where they play live music is available downstairs.

Unfortunately the food was not impressive. Very basic presentation and bland taste, I would say diner level. Prices are ok with the quality of the food.

All in all it was ok, definitely not in line with past reviews and 4.5 star rating. Will need to be more careful next time!",3,"Dined on October 16, 2016"

"My husband and I were blown away by both the quality of food and the level of service. It was our first time dining here, so our attentive waitress provided a few recommendations. 

First, if they have crab cakes on the menu, get the crab cakes!

We ordered a nice bottle of Pinot so it would couldn't both salmon and lamb. Both entrees were tasty, perfectly, prepared, and plated nicely. In fact, the lamb was so good that I almost forgot my table manners :)

We rarely (never) get dessert, and our waitress surprised us with their signature key lime pie. It was amazing!

"North Square is part of what once the most horrific hotel in NYC. I had to stay there in my youth for reasons that no longer matter.  Many years ago, someone snatched it up, cleared it out and made it a little NYC gem, a stellar boutique hotel that includes this delightful dining spot, North Square.  It's a place where normal people eat. And that doesn't mean ""old"" or ""out of touch.""  Just people who love good food, don't read their e-mails while dining, respond to the warmth and knowledge of its waitstaff, the lovely wine list,  un-shocking prices--and just damned good food, superbly prepared and served on time.  I have brought several people from out of town here who request that we return when they visit again. And you don't have to call 30 days in advance for a reservation. A true little treasure just across from Washington Square Park which, despite greedy developers, remains intact and beautiful. If you're after a completely lovely evening, here it is.",5,"Dined on September 22, 2016"

I was extremely pleased when our waiter topped off my second glass of wine as a courtesy when he saw that it was gone and I had not finished my meal. He gave me a little extra--I thought that was terrific. It's little things like that that would incline me to come back to the restaurant. It's NYC and the truth is, there are a lot of upscale great restaurants. Great, welcoming service is harder to find, in my opinion. Oh and I forgot--when ordering wine by the glass we were given a chance to taste it first and say yes or no. I've never seen that before. Food and service and ambiance were all outstanding.",5,"Dined on June 8, 2016"

For an appetizer, I had the scallops risotto, which was one of the specials for the night and my friend had a crab meat salad.  Both were delicious.  For the main course, I had the breast of duck, which was prepared medium, just as I requested.  My friend had the fish special which was moist and not overcooked as  has happened on occasion in other restaurants.  We were very pleased with the main courses.  For desert, we ordered the platter of cookies which was a nice assortment of chocolate and other flavors.  It was more than enough for two but so good we finished all of them.  We also ordered a bottle of the French Bordeaux (2010 vintage) that was offered as a special for restaurant week  even though one of us was having fish.  We both enjoyed it so much that we hope to be able to find a place where we can buy it for home use.  All in all a fantastic evening.   We look forward to returning to North Square soon!",5,"Dined on February 2, 2016"

Nestled in the basement of a modest hotel next to WSPark this dining sit seems to be supported by NYU profs/admin. Food definitely not the attraction and the bar scene is nonexistent. Everything we ate was fair and that's being kind.,3,"Dined on January 28, 2016"
"Love this place!  It's my #1 choice for lunch or dinner near Washington Square Park.  They have never let me down.  I now love it even more knowing that they don't skimp when it's Restaurant Week.  They pay attention when I order my picky martini, the tuna tartare is always fresh and tasty, and the dessert was to die for.",4,"Dined on January 26, 2016"

"Nicely done for first week of restaurant week.  Unlike some other restuarants this one puts THREE separate menus in place, one for each week.  We went for the first of the three, which was the least quirky menu, with mostly winter comfort foods on the list.  Nicely limited menu, with just the right kind of variety.  The appetizer of gnocchi with a variety of flavorings was really a sort of Asian-Mexican-American Fusion dish.  The New England Clam Chowder was a leek and potato based soup, rather than an overly cream-based-artery clogger.  The broth contain a number of large plump clams, which inspires the kid in your brain with treasure hunt anticipation.  Pork rib-eye was perfectly done comfort food, with one outstanding quality.  This was the most tender perfectly cooked pork chop I've ever eaten, and I've had a few.  Another stand out, the coffee Crème Brule was the most generous such desert size I've yet seen.  This is especially nice for sharing.  The pricing for restaurant week wasn't an outrageous bargain; essentially you get the desert for free.  But on the plus side, at $3.00 a cup, this restaurant also doesn't rip you off for $5.00 for a cup of tea or coffee, as many do. 

The crowd was an odd mix of aging dowagers, just barely doddering into their seats, left-over Village hippie era retirees, who likely live in the area and won't give up their Brownstones until they are dead, maybe even not then (their kids will inherit them), and a few youngish loved-up couples on a romantic date.  

Service was attentive and pleasant, just right, despite the place being busy on a Thursday night.  The flow was impressive.  Tables would empty and fill right up again, so the reservation scheduling was clearly seamless and well done - and required if you want to get a table on a busy evening.",4,"Dined on January 22, 2016"

The omelette was delicious and nicely prepared  with a generous serving of fillers.  I asked the staff to skip the potatoes and add an extra helping of greens - all of which was done cheerfully.   Service was very attentive and the overall atmosphere of North Square makes it a top place to enjoy a Sunday Jazz Brunch.",5,"Dined on December 20, 2015"
"Soggy endive salad, overlooked calamari and lackluster service were not what we expected from this intimate, pleasant looking restaurant.  The good news is the noise levels are low so we were able to enjoy our conversation but I would rather spend 10-20% more at any number of vibrant local restaurants that offer a more interesting and tasty menu.  We will not return.",2,"Dined on December 20, 2015"
"We tried this restaurant because it was a 1,000 point special.  Try this place if you are in the neighborhood and want solid, reasonably priced food.  Otherwise, there are far better options.  Our server was incredibly polite, but her station appeared to be too large for her to handle.  Also, when I ordered the duck, she stated that the chef suggested that it be served ""medium"" or it would be ""tough.""  Suggestion: buy better duck.  In the neither here nor there category, we were the youngest people in the restaurant by about 25 years.  If you are looking for the next trendy spot, keep moving.",3,"Dined on December 20, 2015"

"I avoid brunch usually: I don't eat pancakes or waffles and I tire of endless egg dishes.  NS offers non-traditional brunch fare, more like a mix of brunch and lunch dishes.  They make a mean traditional Caesar salad - you can taste the lemon and the anchovies and the lettuce is broken into bite-size pieces, not the big leaves that require a knife to negotiate.  The Arctic char was perfectly broiled and rested on a bed of garlicy steamed spinach and a thin potato galette.  And they know how to make a perfect Hendrick's martini that meets my picky expectations.",4,"Dined on December 6, 2015"

"North Square is a great and always reliable place for a jazz brunch in the City.   Rox Corral brings an ever changing and world class jazz ensemble to this quaint Village restaurant each Sunday.  Aside from the top flight music talent, the kitchen turns out some tasty brunch cuisine.  Starting with the assorted bread basket, I'd highly recommend the brunch pre fixe, with an assortment of sweet and savory items to please any diner.  Service was excellent and very attentive.  North Square is a must visit for any serious lover of good food and jazz on a Sunday.",5,"Dined on November 8, 2015"
"We have been to North Square many times an have always had a very fine meal and experience, otherwise we wouldn't keep going back. This time, we were very disappointed, from the moment we came in (with a reservation). Noticing many tables that would be able to accommodate the two of us (not encroaching on fours), we were rudely told we had to take the seats in the fron by the door. The server was friendly, helpful and accommodating, but the dinner (Duck Breast ) lacked flavor  and was not up to their usual standard.

Quiet and with tables suited more for small groups, the restaurant has a dimly lit but somehow vibrant bar where you can relax before or after your meal.

The selections on the three-course menu were all tasty - even the herb-roasted chicken was tender and juicy.

We visited on Halloween, and even with the distraction of costumes and the preparations for the parade, the servers are professional and attentive.

I guess most locals know about it as there was literally a traffic jam in the entrance, even at 2PM.

My husband and I decided to stay over the the city and go out for a jazz brunch on Sunday morning.  North Square's brunch had received very good reviews.  Boy were we disappointed.  The food and service were good.  We think the music was good but the  people at other tables were talking so loud you couldn't hear the music.  It was very distracting and rude to the singer.    If they wanted to talk why didn't they sit in the restaurant room as opposed to the lounge.  North Square did nothing to encourage the table to listen to the music.The lounge only has 10 tables which should make for an excellent and intimate jazz brunch.  This was not bettter then background musc being pumped in.  We would never go back or suggest friends go.,3,"Dined on September 20, 2015"

The food was excellent, the service was really good and the price was very reasonable, about $40.00 tax and tip, but no drinks other than coffee. My wife had the Cinnamon & Apple Belgian Waffle. One of her pet peeves is when we have brunch, the food does not come to the table hot. The waffle was just off the grill and was really good. I had the Brunch Tasting (Baby Pumpkin Pecan Pancakes, Two Scrambled Eggs, Chicken & Apple Sausage, Home Fries). The pancakes were excellent, the sausage was just beautiful.

"Not really sure how this place has such high reviews, other than the fact that my expectations must have been too high. Wanted a nice, new place in that neighborhood that we'd never been to. Didn't realize it was attached to a hotel, and it also seemed like a hotel restaurant when you walked in. In fact, it smelled like hotel breakfast (coffee, etc). No one other than us was under the age of 65 on a weeknight. No complaints about the service. The food was just okay. Crostini's missed the mark...none of the flavor profiles really went together and duck confit was poor quality. Tuna tartare was okay, but I didn't like the combination of all the diced raw veggies in it. The fish quality was good, though. For mains, the duck was okay, but had an over-fried spring roll and random black beans on top. My date had the lamb which was pretty good. I don't want to dog the restaurant, it wasn't bad, but it was just small and hotel-ish and the food was not outstanding. I think if I knew that going in, I would have had different expectations.  There's all these mentions of jazz nights there...no idea where they have the room to play jazz music.",3,"Dined on August 5, 2015"

"Loved the jazz listening room - it's separate so those enjoying brunch who aren't into music can sit elsewhere in the restaurant and enjoy themselves equally without disturbing the music listening experience. The quality of the performers is fantastic!  I heard vocalist Roz Corral with Ron Affif on guitar and Paul Gill on bass - an intimate and engaging way to enjoy a Sunday morning. The food was enjoyable though not incredible. It was however very affordable and there was no music charge. Talk about a deal!  This is my third time attending as an out of town guest - and the experience has always been great. Part of my NY routine.

The wine list was okay, we would have preferred more choices by the glass but after speaking to the wine expert decided on a lightly-oaked California Chardonnay which went with our meal superbly. Started with a trio of appetizers which included some smoky duck (good), tuna tartare (best) and a forgetable something else (not so hot), all around good but the third left us wanting. Entrees were cooked to perfection, my partner had the Lobster and I, the Yellowfin Tuna - both wonderful.

"The omelet special and accompanying potatoes and salad were overcooked and tasteless, and the bread basket was skimpy.  Very poor compared to previous meals I've had there, all of which were usually thoughtfully prepared and delicious.  I hope they were just having an off day.",3,"Dined on May 30, 2015"
"I chose this primarily because of it's location - where I was meeting my son after his seminar at NYU - as well as for it's quiet rating as he is hard of hearing and specifically requested a quiet table.

They obliged me with a table upfront - and it was relatively quiet. There still is modest music coming from a speaker and the close tables contribute, but it was fine.

The service was great - not intrusive but keeping tabs on us.  The food was wonderful - we did a prix fixe and both ordered different items which were very good.

I ordered the soft shell crab, cod and bread pudding - and enjoyed all of them.  To be honest, can't remember what my son ordered, but he loved the cheesecake.

Beforehand, waiting for him, I sat at the bar - and talked to the bartender who was incredibly knowledgeable about the seasonal beers and new drinks people were ordering.

Overall, a wonderful evening and we'll be back.",5,"Dined on May 28, 2015"

"It is not so easy to find a restaurant for a group of eight seeing a play at  NYU's  Skirball Center.  North Square did the job very well for us.  We got a table in a back room where we could sit comfortably and talk. The food was entirely satisfactory if not sensational (particularly when we stuck to the simpler items),  and the service was friendly. The waitress was very nice to our nine-year-old  guest -- admittedly a well-behaved foodie -- and we finished in time to get to the play.  We will certainly return there when we are in that part of town again.",4,"Dined on May 16, 2015"

"We opted for a late lunch and had a window seat with a few other tables finishing their meals when we arrived. Our first impression was not all that positive. First of all, the hostess needs a personality. She half heartedly, and without so much as a smile, offered seating options in a wide open dining room. My companion was taking a phone call in the vestibule and while there had to assist elderly patrons to exit the restaurant. All the while the hostess looked on without lifting a finger or afterwards so much as offering a thank you for assisting.  Fortunately the dining experience improved. Our waiter was generally attentive, courteous and efficient. We had the crab cakes, a pork porterhouse sandwich and a duck confit salad and two glasses of wine. What I loved was the fresh ingredients and the mostly salad and veggie accompaniments vs. French fries, rice, and potatoes. The crab cakes were particularly notable but could be improve with a bit of citrus based accompaniment, even a bit more of the existing accompaniment would have improved what was a good choice. The Duck Confit salad was also good but the duck bits were a bit flat in flavor and changing this would make an otherwise good salad into a great salad. The pork sandwich was perhaps the disappointment of the meal as it sounded great on paper but was a bit lackluster in flavor. I am not sure if it is a function of the need to appeal to a wide range of palates why some of the flavors were so muted or if it was a function of our seating being close to the end of the lunch service. Getting our check seemed to be a deer in headlights inspiring experience for the staff member whom we had to draw away from some screen at the hostess station; she seemed visibly annoyed at having to do anything for the restaurant’s guests. Finally we virtually showed ourselves out without a departing thank you while the staff congregated in the rear.",3,"Dined on April 23, 2015"

"We had a nice dinner at this lower ground medium sized restaurant at the northwest corner of Washington  Square. We had the address listed as 103 Waverly place which is a hotel so we assumed it was the entrance and the concierge directed us through the corridors. We noticed once in the restaurant that the entrance to the restaurant is on McDougal, around the corner from Waverly Place.
The atmosphere was cozy. Our waiter gave us a choice of table and we enjoyed a nice dinner.
For appetizer we had fried calamari with a small side of slightly spicy tomato sauce which was good. For entree we had roasted duck and grilled red snapper over a bed of vegetables. Both entrees were delicious. They had several desserts from which we chose a chocolate mousse with dark chocolate ice cream ball equally delicious.
Through the dinner the service was very good.
The decor is art deco like, very nice.
I will certainly recommend this place to anybody looking for good dinner a reasonable price in a nice environment.",4,"Dined on March 29, 2015"

"I have found a new steady.  Went for dinner on Saturday - got a table for 5 with no problem, and everything we ordered was very good - excellent.  My friends all had oysters (I can't comment, but they seemed happy) and then a few apps.  I know the tuna tartare was delicious.  My mushroom ravioli thing was fine, although I was jealous of the tuna app, and regretted not having ordered the butter/radicchio salad w/cheese that I had considered, once I tasted that.  Several of us had the steak, which was tender and buttery, and for me that more than made up for the excess of pepper in my first bite.  But I'm not a huge pepper fan, and I much preferred the mustard that came on the side  (and the big fat steak fries were just the way I like them).   My friend was very happy with her duck entree and we shared some desserts but I was so full at that point I only had a bite or two.   We were all full but the desserts were finished.   Oh, the Sancerre by the glass was excellent.  Not inexpensive overall ($300 for 5 including 2 bottles of wine, before tip),  but a great location and WONDERFUL service.  Definitely recommend.",5,"Dined on March 15, 2015"

"I come here often.  The food is good, well-prepared, fairly priced, and it's a good local spot to meet neighborhood friends for dinner.  My one complaint is that the staff are a little over eager when it comes to taking your order, taking away your dishes, and collecting the check;  I often feel rushed, even when it's not particularly crowded.  

To those reviewers who have noted, rather snidely, that North Square draws an older crowd -- get over it already; you didn't invent going out and having a good time.  If all you want is to be seen with your own precious little demographic, there are plenty of other places that will accommodate you until you age out yourselves.",4,"Dined on February 28, 2015"
"I attend the jazz brunch to hear the always wonderful Roz Corral singing with her band of world class musicians in this intimate setting.  The brunch is always good, with a nice assortment of breads and muffins starting the meal.  The brunch tasting menu is great and I had an omelette with the choice of two fillings, served with a nicely dressed side of greens and home fries.  Service is one of the weaker points in this experience, with inconsistent refill of coffee and water.  Overall, this is a great place to have brunch and hear some outstanding music.",4,"Dined on February 22, 2015"
"We took advance of the 3-course Restaurant Week lunch special as part of a day of wedding dress shopping. We were seated promptly at 1:30 and were able to order an off-menu bottle of cava for our table. Three out of four of us started with the butternut squash soup and we all agreed that it was very under seasoned, as though they forgot to add salt and pepper. Despite the initial let down of the soup, the following two courses more than made up for it. The scallop entree was perfectly cooked and all three dessert options were fantastic.",4,"Dined on February 20, 2015"
"The restaurant is ripe for the aged between the high level of lighting and virtual no background music. The food was okay, nothing to rave over.

We arrived (after calling first) early for our reservation. The restaurant was practically empty yet, we were offered two tables right next to other people. When I asked for the empty booth in the back, I was told it was specifically requested and reserved by other people.

The woman at the table next to us was very loud and talked the entire time, even while eating her food. Since the ""booth"" and many other tables were still empty one plus hour after we had arrived, I discreetly asked to be seated for the dessert course at a different table.

Again, the hostess claimed they were fully booked and offered me a table in the noisy lounge next door.  We declined. The waiter was amazing though and a short time later, quietly came over and poured me more wine gratis.

By the time we left the booth I had requested had JUST been seated but, the booth next to it had been empty for at least 45 minutes. Several tables at the restaurant had NEVER been filled and remained empty.

The food was probably better than the 3 stars but we all suffered from salt overdose later and were all drinking water like mad.
Chefs should realise that 1990s methods of flavouring have moved on and salt should be on the table not in the food.
We were well served but it was very stilted. If I was the owner I would be worried about the loose canons being left to their own devices.

"While the food and atmosphere are still fine, I am beginning to wonder about the service. The waitress did not seem fully attentive and kept disappearing. We had to enlist the greeter to get bread and then again to get our check. For the second time they didn't ask whether we wanted coffee until we were finishing our dessert. A troubling trend.",4,"Dined on May 18, 2014"

"Travelling on business, I chose this restaurant because it was convenient. I was beyond pleased. Often , servers aren't thrilled to have a one-top but I was given professional and attentive service by everyone on duty. The radicchio and Bibb lettuce salad with creamy goat cheese and roasted beets could have been a meal in itself along with the excellent bread and olives that are set on the table. I had the filet au poivre and frites. It was prepared perfectly and the au jus was so tasty. It came with roasted Vidalia onions which I gobbled up because I am a fool for Vidalias. The potatoes were so-so but didn't detract greatly from the meal. I wish I had room for dessert since the selections looked wonderful.",4,"Dined on May 13, 2014"

"We have eaten at North Square many times - both brunch and dinner. We have always been very pleased and walk away
looking forward to our return. Try the brunch sampler. An amazing array of tastes - but then you will miss the French Toast....
among the best we gave ever tasted . Dinner time, the eatery gets romantic. With the lights subdued, NS becomes redecorated
and ready for that special evening out. Once again the menu presents many interesting and well prepared choices.
The portions are not big, but just about the right size for dinner. You'll walk out feeling comfortable . We have found the
dinner service to be a little slow on several occasions. Overall NS feels like a Secret Neighborhood Treasure.

The place is great for a business lunch or when you need to hear each other talk. It's not cramped like a lot of restaurants. The food was good. It isn't cheap but equivalent to others in the area of its kind. These service was odd - we never got a waiter so finally had to ask the hostess. It seemed they were reluctant to serve us an we had different people come to the table at different times. It took a very long time overall.,3,"Dined on April 2, 2014"
"Invited friends from out of town and we were delighted to have chosen North Square. EVERY DISH was a hit...well prepared, creative and beautifully presented.

If you can, be served by Gabriel...absolutely charming and efficient.",5,"Dined on March 31, 2014"

"The food is excellent. Many classic dishes with a contemporary twist, preparation outstanding. Everything is made with care and attention, and therefore delicious. The rack of lamb was perfectly seasoned, pink inside, just as it should be. Potato galette was also perfect: full of flavor, not heavy of fatty. My dining companion had the short ribs -- absolutely no fat (not easy with short ribs), in a richly flavored sauce with ancho chili and other mysterious flavors -- cinnamon? Delicious.
Best of all: it's quiet! You can hear whoever is on the other side of the table and have a conversation. Music is muted classic jazz, staff is friendly, relaxed and efficient.",4,"Dined on March 20, 2014"

"I made a business lunch reservation for ten and received the slowest service throughout the experience. The venue seemed understaffed delaying every aspect of the service. They were slow in putting bread on the table, taking our order and getting the food on the table. The group was so hungry the bread bowl was empty within minutes yet never replenished. The food was wonderful and so is the decor of the restaurant. But overall, the service needed improvement. What made the afternoon worse was the insensitivity of the waitstaff. No one came over to explain the delays. After everyone was finally served, I politely mentioned it to the server, who offered a defensive explanation but nothing more. Not good for business!",1,"Dined on March 7, 2014"

"The one saving grace about our experience was Rick the bartender. We should have stayed at the bar instead of being sat at our table. Our table for two was in between tables of parties four. The food was average. What really disappointed us was that at end of dinner I was charged extra for a glass wine that was not ordered. They did fix that, but when checking my bank account the next day I was not only charged for half the bill I shared with my partner, but also I was double charged for the whole bill. We also wondered where our waitress went because at the end of night, the bus boy was taking care of us. Let's just say we will not be returning here again.",2,"Dined on March 2, 2014"

I made this request clear on my Opentable reservation note as requested by the restaurant. The man at check in gave me a semi lecture about making a special call ahead to reserve as they had so many reservations. Really? I thought that was the purpose of the ""notes"" section. In any event, the brunch was tasty as always. I love the bread basket with the cranberry nut bread and other assorted goodies. My omelette was cooked to order with a delicious salad. Service was just ok, and appeared disorganized. As always, the music was outstanding!",3,"Dined on February 23, 2014"

Scallops were tough, quinoa was dry and tasteless. The waitress didn't seemed knew and not very knowledgeable, but was hesitant to find out the answers, it was like she was discouraging us to ask anything.

The atmosphere was quiet -- a plus in my book, but it may be a little too quiet for some -- it's generally an older crowd, and I wouldn't call it a hip spot.

Once our order was finally placed, there was another wait, but a variety of delicious breads and mini-muffins helped quell the hunger pangs. When our entrees finally arrived, the food was nicely presented, delicious (both meals) and reasonably priced.

Really nice menu. My fish was fabulous. But our waitress was so unfriendly.,3,"Dined on October 19, 2013"
"North Square is the perfect respite on a dark chilly evening in Washington Square offering a warm welcoming setting with a ‘speak easy’ feel. The cuisine is equally pleasing with service that is attentive but not overbearing. The entrees are presented beautifully and are just as sumptuous – we enjoyed pan-seared halibut and grilled pork rib eye which is as moist and delicious as a perfect filet mignon. There as so many excellent choices that we depended on our waiter to narrow the possibilities – he was well versed offering additional enticing details, from the wine selection to dessert. Pressed coffee is the final touch at this Village gem - also great for brunch, lunch, afternoon tea, a picnic basket for the Park – and a lounge for jazz.",4,"Dined on October 13, 2013"
"Seated in the bar area, we were treated to blasts of cold air every time the door opened (frequently). The waitress, dismissed the complaint, refused to see if any other table was available. In general she was ungracious.",2,"Dined on October 10, 2013"

Always go here after theater in area as there is excellent food and service. A most congenial neighborhood spot.,5,"Dined on September 7, 2013"
"We've long liked ""North Square"" restaurant opposite Washington Square in Greenwich Village. Food, service, and ambience make it one of the most comfortable restaurants in New York. A group of 4 can actually have a conversation while eating - the noise level is pleasantly under control. On our most recent visit (9/6/13), low noise level and very attentive staff made us comfortable as always.. However the food seemed less fresh, less well-prepared and served compared to earlier visits. Perhaps it was the chef's night off, but the food (including the wine and the desserts) were just ""off"". For example the Arctic Char tasted fishy rather than fresh, and the dessert rather bland. We will certainly return, expecting better food.",3,"Dined on September 7, 2013"
"Made a reservation and didn't realize you have to notify the restaurant that you want to have brunch listening to the jazz performance. Got there and they sat us in the normal dining area. There was no jazz to be heard. So when we asked, the jazz area was already full - which absolutely sucked because that's the reason why we wanted to eat there. So make sure somewhere on Opentable you tell them you want the jazz brunch, or like me, you'll miss out. Sad. But the food was good and very reasonably priced.",4,"Dined on September 1, 2013"
"I broke my rule of not eating in a hotel restaurant for fine dining. I will now go back to following my rule. I selected this restaurant because of the internet reviews. Rack of lamb had a mustard flavor-yuk. Waiter forgot one of our salads. When we reminded him, he placed the order, delivered it, and graciously comped the salad. The other meals were fair; nothing outstanding. there are too many great restaurants in New York City to not pass up in lieu of North Square.",2,"Dined on September 1, 2013"
"The food was incredible. Ordered the pork dish per the waiter's recommendation. The staff was helpful in explaining all of the dishes, and prompt in taking our orders, bringing the food, and clearing plates. The desserts too were also quite delicious. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience overall, and would definitely recommend to anyone who's looking to have a more upscale, delicious dinner in a fun neighborhood.",5,"Dined on September 1, 2013"

"Our first visit to North Square was a very mixed experience. Service was friendly but poor. Although the restaurant wasn't croweded, we sat for half an hour before anyone showed up to move beyond the ""Here are your menus"" stage, and we were only able to place our order (for drinks *and* dinner, as a precaution) after hailing the hostess and asking her to find someone. Entrees also took too long to arrive, and the meal itself was uneven: kale salad with apples and buttermilk dressing was plentiful and delicious, the duck breast was succulent, the sauteed halibut was dry and flavorless and the vegetable accompaniments were brown and blandly prepared. The place is pretty, tables are well-spaced, but I doubt we'll be going back.",2,"Dined on August 26, 2013"
"ALthough the location can't be beat--- right off Wasshing Square Park, and the food was good enough.... the service bordered on abysmal. Our table was tucked into a corner (which we liked), but it was nearly impossible to get the attention of a waiter, or busboy... or anyone, for that matter. The vibe was one of casual indifference. North Square lacked a soul -- there was no staff member that seemed happy enough to be serving diners, or really be bothered with any of the aspects of running a restaurant. It is a shame, since the location is great, the food is decent, and the ambience is pleasant. THis was one dining experience where the inattention and general maiaise of the staff had a negative effect on the whole night out.",2,"Dined on August 23, 2013"
Met a colleague for a discrete lunch and North Square was perfect. I had the Shrimp Tempura sandwich and my friend a nice salad. The food was great and so was the service. It was particularly quiet due to the season and I expect it is louder and more bustling when the NYU students come back on campus.,4,"Dined on August 21, 2013"

"North Square is great for listening in on delightful conversations - and none of them are on cell phones. New Yorkers tend to be opinionated and vocal and they enjoy a good Cobb salad (my husband's choice) or blueberry pear pancakes (mine). What fun to be near NYU and the park, a little oasis in the busy downtown arena.",4,"Dined on August 10, 2013"
"North Square is my ""go to place."" I have been eating there for many years and NEVER been disappointed. The food is elegant but not fussy the wait staff is knowledgeable and has the right balance between being engaging and unobtrusive. I have brought everyone from colleagues to my young nephews (7 & 9) to my parents - no one has been disappointed. One thing I truly appreciate is that the noise level is not overpowering and the table can converse without competing with other conversations or music that is too loud.

Go - you'll certainly return!",5,"Dined on August 1, 2013"

"Do not hesitate to frequent this Sunday Jazz Brunch gem in the heart of Washington Square. The jazz was phenomenal, the food excellent, the prices reasonable. North Square seems to attract a smart crowd interested in quiet conversation and music for the soul . We sat in the Lounge for the jazz brunch - The Roz Corral Trio set the tone nicely and created an intimate atmosphere. Attentive and classy wait staff. No attitude here. Just a nice vibe. The prix fixe ($20) well worth every bit. Pecan pancakes made my day. Other members of my family enjoyed the Eggs Benedict and very generous pours on the Bloody Marys. Menu has great variety expertly prepared. This place is a gem; understated elegance worth every penny. I will return.",5,"Dined on July 28, 2013"
"The food was good, but the service was slow and not efficient at all. Had to call the waiter several times to order beverages. Our appetizer came first then our drinks.",3,"Dined on July 21, 2013"
"Yes, it's full of senior citizens, but if you want quiet, come here. The food there is outstanding, but the service does NOT match the food. I get a feeling that they deal with so many particular, old folks that they're just tired. I mentioned in my reservation that it was my 92 year old uncles birthday. Ordered dessert and NOTHIN. You would think a restaurant of this caliber would've just done something. A candle, write on the plate in chocolate, something... Had to ask our waiter more than once for a few things, he just always seemed rushed and odd. At times he was good in suggesting menu items. I WILL be back because the food is stellar, and I love the quietness, but get it together on the service.",3,"Dined on July 20, 2013"
"North Square proved to be a perfect gem for our family party of six. We had a quiet table with soft background Jazz to create a lovely, relaxing ambiance. Conversation was easy. The staff was friendly and helpful. The pace of service was not hurried and all our needs were cheerfully met. Ambiance and service aside, what made North Square so awesome was the EXTRAORDINARY food! Everything we ordered, from salads and soups to dessert was nothing short of perfection! We enjoyed options including scallops, duck, Atlantic char and yellow fin tuna. Each was exceptionally delicious and given a magnificent presentation. Add the reasonable menu pricing to complete an unbeatable dinning out experience. We will recommend and return to North Square!",5,"Dined on July 20, 2013"

I fully recommend that restaurant.",4,"Dined on April 27, 2013"

We were seated in the lounge only two tables away from the Jazz group of the day, a Jazz vocalist with a guitar and upright bass accompaniment. The service was excellent and our drinks and food came almost instantly. They were very understanding when the fourth member of our party arrived late, and did not give us a hard time.

When our food arrived, all 5 of us just looked at it for a while. The presentation was amazing. And...it tasted better than it looked. All of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals.

We liked the straight forward cooking: no foam, no sweet relish, no mint jelly with savory dishes. Just very good, traditional, but not old fashioned cuisine. Many items from which to choose: tuna, steak, lamb. We were too full to try the creme brulee or apple crumble. NS will be on our list when we're in the Village.",4,"Dined on February 24, 2013"

After twenty minutes, one of us went downstairs to try to find the third member of the party. She was sitting at a table downstairs; she had been told that she was the first to arrive and had been given a table downstairs. The women who made this mistake were unapologetic. This is the second time such a thing has happened to me; once they put my companion in the back room and me in the front, and it took half an hour before he came out to see if perhaps they had messed things up.

Four of had a lovely dinner at North Square. It's a neighborhood staple. The food is very good mother atmosphere & service are excellent and grown up. I am jaded about all the restaurant hype and the restaurant industrial complex. I like a place that welcomes me; not one that requires me to be grateful to them for letting me in. The location at the NW corner of Washington Square is a plus.,4,"Dined on December 4, 2012"
"This is one my favorite neighborhood restaurants because nicely located, but kind of 'undiscovered', and the food has always been interesting. But it was slightly disappointing this time. My omelet was dry and relatively tasteless, the potatoes were cold and dried out. The service was spotty (eggs arrived very quickly, but coffee seemed to take forever). Also, I really dislike it when wait staff comes over to clear too early and asks ""...still working on that"" ?? Working on it? Hardly an elegant way of describing what is supposed to be a leisurely dining experience. So, on the whole, not what I've come to expect of this lovely little place, but they probably just had a bad day.",3,"Dined on December 3, 2012"
"The only place in NYC where you can have a delicious meal, a great conversation, and not break the bank.",5,"Dined on December 3, 2012"
"I came here for brunch with my sister and had a nice time. We both ordered the brunch sampler. The chicken apple sausage with wonderful, so I would definite recommend ordering that. The pumpkin pancakes, eggs, and potatoes that it also came with it were good, but nothing extraordinary. Service was pleasant without rushing. Overall, I would not object to coming back. But there was nothing unique or particularly memorable about the food or ambiance here that would drive me to come on my own. With so many cute and unique brunches in they city, this one is fine, but nothing I would rush back to. The value here is good with a lot of food and reasonable prices.",3,"Dined on December 2, 2012"

"Cherish North Square as an adult experience for people who don't care about the latest, hottest, trendiest spot but simply want a peaceful experience where quiet conversation can be a central part of the evening. Food is interesting and excellent. Service is seasoned, knowledgable and friendly.",4,"Dined on November 30, 2012"
"Although I don't live in Greenwich Village, North Square is among my favorite restaurants when I venture to this neighborhood. The food, more-or-less French in style, is very nicely prepared and beautifully presented. The service is friendly, if occasionally just a little trifle difficult to summon. The restaurant itself is very pretty, although, alas, noisier than I could wish. Overall, I always enjoy the dining experience here.",5,"Dined on November 28, 2012"

Best and freshest brunch in the village. The prix fixe is great value and the omlette is the best you can get. Good friendly staff and if you can get a booking for the back room with the Jazz..... No better way to spend a Sunday morning!,4,"Dined on November 25, 2012"
"Ordered the brunch special, the poached eggs I asked for were sitting in a bowl with water. The cheddar biscuit was dry and unflavorful, and the pumpkin pancakes were too dense and floppy to be delicious fluffy pancakes. The food was consistently mediocre around the table. The blood orange mimosa was fine, and the jazz music was fine.",2,"Dined on November 25, 2012"
Went for Thanksgiving & had a great time.,4,"Dined on November 23, 2012"
"I always look forward to eating at North Square and am never disappointed. It's one of a very few restaurants where I have trouble ordering because so many of the items on the menu are delicious that it is difficult to choose. This is the third consecutive Thanksgiving I have spent there and I hope to be back for many more. Excellent food, fine service, lovely atmosphere and a civilized noise level. What more does one need?",4,"Dined on November 23, 2012"
"We had a lovely Thanksgiving dinner in this chic neighborhood place. We had a 18-month old along, who enjoyed it, too, and nobody seemed to object.",5,"Dined on November 23, 2012"
"It has the kind of atmosphere I like- you can have a private conversation but it is still lively.We ate the thanksgiving holiday menu and honestlly it is difficult to match moms recipes, but it was nicely prepared. We particularly enjoyed the pecan tart which is saying something because we are from the south.",4,"Dined on November 23, 2012"
Go for the jazz brunch not the food.,3,"Dined on November 18, 2012"
Outstanding service as they called to confirm that we were running late and offered to keep the kitchen open for us. We arrived late without returning their call and they were indeed waiting on us and did keep the kitchen open. Food and atmosphere outstanding.,5,"Dined on November 18, 2012"
"A pleasant, relaxed spot for dinner.",4,"Dined on November 18, 2012"
"I was pleased with everything except 2 issues with the service: I wanted my beer with my meal and after waiting then starting my meal I had to ask again for it. That would've been fine except when dessert was ordered I also ordered coffee which I like to enjoy with my dessert but I had to ask a second time for it and it took too long to get it, dessert was about over at that point. No offer to give me the coffee on the house. Little things like that ruined what would've been a great meal.",3,"Dined on November 18, 2012"
"Really good food, delicious condiments, great wine chosen by our server, nice ambience. Portions were a little small but we will definitely be back!",4,"Dined on November 16, 2012"
"Dined here with my boyfriend and felt like I was back in a time warp.
The decor of the restaurant was outdated and I did not feel like I was dining in NYC but rather somewhere out in Ohio. Waited longer than usual for our cocktails and jokingly said they went next door or down the block to get them. I was not impressed with the service nor can remember the menu so this restaurant was definately a one off experience and unfortunately will not be returning.",2,"Dined on November 13, 2012"
The lamb chops are outstanding; among the tops in NYC.,5,"Dined on November 13, 2012"
"I attended the jazz brunch to hear Roz Corral and had a wonderful afternoon. In addition to the high quality of the music, the space is cozy and a very nice place to spend the afternoon. As always, the food was outstanding. I ordered the brunch prix fixe, which included a delicious classic omelette, a mimosa, and coffee. The bread is almost a meal in itself, and the cranberry slices are heavenly. This is one of my favorite brunch spots in the city and I always look forward to a visit to North Square!",5,"Dined on November 11, 2012"
"The service here was great and the food was tasty. However, this restaurant is actually located in a hotel, so the dining scene is not what we expected when we arrived (we were about 40 years younger than most diners). That said, it was nice to be somewhere calmer and less crowded than other restaurants in the area tend to be!",4,"Dined on November 11, 2012"
"Was seeing a show at NYU and was looking for a nice, moderately priced restaurant nearby. Found this one in Zagat and booked through Open Table. My wife and I were both very impressed with the food and even more impressed with the bill. We both had appetizers - a salad for her, tuna sashimi for me, which were very good. And the main courses - tuna steak for her, seared scallops for me - were both excellent. Service was very friendly but not overbearing and timing of courses was perfect. Total bill with tax and tip (neither of us had drinks) was $75. Really and excellent experience.",5,"Dined on November 11, 2012"

Nice selection of wines and the service was terrific. We'll definitely return!",4,"Dined on October 27, 2012"
"As much as the food was very nice, the ambiance was not appealing at all. I felt like I was in an old diner or something. I don't think I would go back.",3,"Dined on October 25, 2012"
"This restaurant is located on a charming street corner in the Village across from Washington Square Park -- in fact, it is part of one of our favorite places to stay in NY, the Washington Square Hotel. We eat jere our first night each time we stay at the hotel. You'll never be disappointed with the seasonal fare and warm, attentive service. We love this place!",5,"Dined on October 25, 2012"
"I always love North Square - there's a reason why locals eat here - the food is spectacular, there's no over-hip snootiness and the fact that the dining room is parallelled by a separate bar space with dining lounge is a stroke of genius (there's nothing worse than sitting down for dinner in a restaurant and having the drinks and nibbles crowd noise and elbow you into a bad experience).

The fact that it's off the beaten path a bit also helps.

I will keep coming back here and always bring friends.",5,"Dined on October 25, 2012"

"We dined at North Square the night of October 16 on the advice ofor firends, with whom we celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary. As our friends are from Sydney, AUS, we rarely get to see them and a quiet restaurant with excellent food was what we wished. North Square was perfect. In addition to the great food, the staff was flexible when one of our party changed his mind about his wine, and understood that our friends' son was there only for a drink and then off to work. Tow days later, my wife is still raving about the Scallops, whereas I am ecstatic about the lamb. On top of everthing else, we lingered for quite some time and di not feel rushed to leave.",5,"Dined on October 17, 2012"
"It is getting all too rare to find a restaurant without a surfeit of ambient noise pollution. North Square does not pipe in excessively loud music and they actually have a noise-absorbing ceiling lining. It is a quaint place with a lot of class, great sea scallops and feels like old New York. Like Waverly Inn but without the attitude and pretension.",4,"Dined on October 13, 2012"

"Came here for brunch - the place was very nice and cozy. Felt like being inside a countryside Inn. The crowd was mostly older. The brunch menu was pretty expansive and the food portions were big for NYC standards. I ordered a reisling which was pretty delicious and the portion was pretty generous as well. We sat and talked for a while after finishing our meals but since the place wasn't crowded, the waitress was nice enough to not rush us at all. Would def consider coming back!",3,"Dined on September 30, 2012"

We tried a couple of different items on the menu from last time but, every choice was delicious with much ""Oh you have to taste this"".",4,"Dined on September 22, 2012"
North Square is a secret worth keeping. Professors from NYU eat there and overheard conversations are invigorating. The Cobb Salad is one of North Square's best surprises. For such a standard dish to be so spectacular is a blue ribbon for the restaurant.,4,"Dined on September 21, 2012"

I've eaten here over the course of 10 years at least 50 times. It remains one of the few places I can count on for a truly delicious meal in a perfect setting.

"I've been here twice, and an definitely going to return in the future. The service is generally friendly and attentive, the wine list is well-priced and eclectic, the food ranges between ""good"" and ""outstanding"", and the ambiance is perfect for a nice, quiet dinner.

Outstanding dishes:
-Rack of Lamb (Perfectly cooked, tender. Delicious.)
-The shrimp appetizer.
-Scallop and Salmon Terrine ~~[[This was actually given as compliments of the house. Thanks!]]
-The rhubarb and strawberry crumble

Wine... Yes their wine list rocks. The markup seems to generally be ~80-100%. So that means that a $30 bottle will be $50-60. Both of the below were great.

Brunch was ample for the $20. We got juice (or you can have coffee), blood orange mimosa, cheese and mushroom omelette which comes with a nice salad, home fries, and scone. Couldn't finish it all. Waitstaff was attentive.

Traveled two hours from LI this time, and asked a collegue from abroad to join my husband and me for brunch. I wish we had gone to the diner instead!!! The omelets were over-cooked, the salad had wilted from the heat lamps (or something) and the home-fries were tasteless. I should have sent it all back. I was hoping for a nice, perfect omelet, based on my previous experience at North Square, but no. The bread was good, but I would guess, left over from dinner the night before.

It can be a little noisy if you are trying to have a conversation but the jazz is great if that's what you like. Very nice brunch menu. I will go back.",4,"Dined on June 3, 2012"

"The food was excellent and the service fine until the check arrived. We were charged $42. for the prix fixe dinner whcih was clearly priced at $40. on both the menu we were given and the one posted outside. When brought to the attention of the waitress, she said she would check. After a long wait, she returned to say the price increase was in the computer, but not yet on the menu. When I replied I expected to be charged the menu price, she said she could not override the computer and would get the manager. After more than a 10 minute wait, she returned to say the manager was coming. All in, we sat there over 15 minutes before a $4. overcharge was corrected, without apology. Spoiled a nice dining experience. Not sure I will go back.",2,"Dined on May 17, 2012"

"We must have walked past this restaurant many, many times over the years - and never noticed it! What a pleasant surprise to finally find it!

"North Square does it's very best to please, and that it does, in spades. The food was high quality- they clearly strive to be a first class dining experience. The prices are reasonable especially considering the great food and service. This place is a ""find.""

"A bit hidden but once you step in the restaurant was inviting. Sat at a corner banquet and the waitstaff was very professional and made sure we made it to our show. The food was good, had the shortribs which were tasty but a bit dry. We asked for and got a little extra sauce and they were perfect. Nice chopped salad and the caramel pistachio ice cream cookie was fantastic, wish there were two on the plate",4,"Dined on April 14, 2012"
"We'd been to North Square before and thought it would be a nice local place for Easter Sunday. When I made the reservation for 3:45 pm, I didn't confirm if there would be a special menu for Easter. There wasn't; at least not at 3:45. The waiter said the dinner menu was available at 5:30. We had the regular brunch menu (eggs, pancakes, etc.). We were disappointed, but made the best of it. The lobster-crab cakes were delicious as was the buccatini with chicken. Next time, I'll ask about the menu.",4,"Dined on April 9, 2012"

"My boyfriend and I went to a North Square event at the Washington Square Hotel. We go to a lot of similar events (Brooklyn Brewery does them often) and this event was shockingly awful. Completely disorganized; made people who were paying $65 per plate wait, as the event started a half hour late, without providing any drinks. The seating arrangement, once we were sitting, was such that I was elbowed in the head every 20 minutes by a waiter. There were about 45 minutes between each of the courses. What's better than waiting forever for food that is less than mediocre? Then there's the decor/ambience --- the odd IHOP-like lighting, the no music, the cramped seating. There was nothing positive about the experience here.",1,"Dined on April 4, 2012"

"Having been to North Square many wonderful times, I'm hate to report that this time was a nightmare! They had a huge party that made it difficult for others to get good service. I'm sorry to rate my visit as poor - it wasn't the waiter's fault and the bartender did comp drinks for us - but I hope in the future - while realizing they want to accommodate everyone - that they don't have huge parties in the music room. Our food was served almost an hour and a half after the start of our reservation. The party goers had no sense of decorum, running around and showing each other things on their laptops and basically ruining the whole experience for us. All that being said, I do look forward to returning at a quieter time.",1,"Dined on March 11, 2012"
"Perfect for a pre-NYU show dinner...with two performers and two audience members. The food came on time for the performers, and for those of us who could afford to linger, there was no pressure to leave! And what wonderfully prepared food it was! Quite fabulous salads...we each had different ones and tasting them, I relished the joyfully subtle differences.
The entrees were perfect too..
and the lime/celantro sorbet was so stimulating I quite forgot to stop after only a taste!",5,"Dined on March 9, 2012"

"Another fine experience at our favorite mid-village restaurant. It's always good, always quiet, friendly, and reasonably priced. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary on an early Sunday night, and we were offered a nice corner table, as per our request on Open Table. Following our meal of radiccio and boston leaf salad (perfectly dressed), and a terrific roasted tomato soup with shrimp and shoestring potatoes, a mushroom tart, and one very tender short ribs, we were already satisfied without dessert. But the kitchen surprised and delighted us with lovely cookies and little glasses of champagne on the house before we left. Service was relaxed, seamless, well organized.",4,"Dined on February 20, 2012"

"We have visited North Square Restaurant on many occasions for Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner. Each time we visited the food was excellent and the service was attentive. The Price fix meal for Valentine's Day offered great selection and each item tasted delicious. The price was also very reasonable both for the quality & amount of food and also for the wine. The ambiance is very good & the sound level is very low. North Square is truly a great restaurant to have great food, attentive service and to share food with a friend or business associate.

"Mainly I was disturbed that they did not know how to handle my food allergy. I cannot consume nitrites which is a preservative found in cured meats (e.g. bacon, chorizo) and the server had trouble understanding me and relaying back to the kitchen. By the time we were ready to order he recommended I stick to the fish to prevent any issues but that was because he was not understanding my allergy. Instead of taking the time to understand it, he simply wrote off all meat items on the menu. I ended up having the chicken, and it was just ok.",3,"Dined on February 8, 2012"
"Wonderful as always, food always top notch - this time tuna tartare on a bed of avocado (live the detail or black sesame seed crusted crisps and sprouted black sesame seed garnish) and pork loin which was constructed like a jelly roll (if the cake was pork and the filling was bacon) sitting on a bed of cooked squash. My only quibble (this time, not normally) is that I had to work to get the staff's attention. They all seemed lost in their own conversations and the guests were an afterthought.",4,"Dined on February 7, 2012"

The wine list was very good and we very much enjoyed the Malbec we ordered. When we ordered we opted try a bit of everything and were impressed by virtually everything we got, particularly the campellini as an appetizer and the bread budding for dessert. For dinner my date got the filet and I got the cod and both of us were big fans.",4,"Dined on February 4, 2012"

"A surprising find, this one. The decor is more 1980 than 2012 but the food and the cooking were pretty good. We went during NYC restaurant week. Unlike our other restaurant week choice, they didn't scrimp on the portion sizes. Very good service. The ambience was a bit stuffy and as a couple in our 40s, we were positively youthfull compared to our fellow diners. All in all, a good restaurant with some solid cooking.",4,"Dined on January 28, 2012"

The wine list is nice and long and the food, from appetizers to dessert, was amazing! The only down fall was my very nice waitress brought out our appetizers and then disappeared.

"North Square is a wonderful restaurant. Besides having very good food, it is one of the few restaurants that is quiet--great for conversation. It is also very attractive and comfortable.

"We have eaten here many times, we chose North Square for our New Year's Eve dinner with two other couples because the food is always excellent, and, unlike other restaurants, they do not create a ""special"" holiday menu to gouge you. North Square offers wonderful and interesting choices, not only as dinner selections designed by the chef, but also as a la carte choices. They are completely accommodating when you ask to substitute one thing for another, a choice not always offered at other supposedly high class places. We've had both brunch and dinner here numerous times and are never apprehensive about introducing North Square to our friends, everyone always leaves extremely pleased. The atmosphere is cozy and friendly.",5,"Dined on January 1, 2012"

WE were very impressed with the food - everything was delicious and very reasonably priced.

"North Square is one of my favorite restaurants. Unfortunately, they had a very bad night on this week. The mushroom soup had no culinary flair; it was as if they just put mushrooms in a blender and poured the result into a bowl. We ordered wine, appetizers (soup and salad), and raw oysters. The appetizers came first, and the oysters arrived while we had the appetizers. We still hadn't been served the wine. Dinners (duck and halibut) were so-so. Not at all on the level I had come to expect.",2,"Dined on December 1, 2011"

Outstanding place! We had a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner.,5,"Dined on November 25, 2011"
"Thanksgiving prix-fixe menu offered great variety at a surprisingly moderate price. The food was quite good; in some cases excellent. Sadly, the service was not. After we were seated, we waited quite some time for our server to take drink orders. When I asked if there were any specialty cocktails, she disappeared for another long stretch, came back with a cocktail list and vanished again. When we finally got to order, we learned that one of our drinks (a very standard order) could not be made as the bar had run out of stock. Our server, while pleasant enough, seemed unfamiliar with the menu and rather bewildered in general. That said, I would try North Square again on a non-holiday in the hope that the service might compare to the food",3,"Dined on November 25, 2011"

She offered us a small table by the main door, but we politely declined. We told her we were willing to wait for a nice table. She rudely responded by saying we would have to wait a LONG time for a table. She appeared unable to think calmly, and it was clear she wanted to get rid of us in order to focus on someone else. She then offered us a table in the bar section. My girlfriend and I said we would take a look and decide. So she then rudely called to one of her staff, ""Go show them this table!"" She had no manners at all.",1,"Dined on November 20, 2011"

"Very pleasant prix-fixe brunch, although selections are extremely limited. My companion opted to order from the extensive a la carte menu, instead, and declared his food delicious. My prix-fixe omelet was fluffy but somewhat bland; bloody mary nicely seasoned but lacking kick. Delicious coffee; dark-roast, strong, piping hot. The bread basket is worth breaking your carb fast, but it only seemed to be offered with the a la carte food -- we had to request one. Female waiter was a bit hearty; didn't seem to have the polish I remembered and expected from visits in the past.",4,"Dined on November 14, 2011"

"Occasionally the food at North Square is a little tepid in its seasoning, but most of the time I come away impressed by how excellent the food is, especially during lunchtime. The crab and pear salad is one of my all-time favorite salads, and the tuna tartare is the best version I've had of this over-made dish. I've never had a bad meal there, and on top of everything else, they have an excellent (and changing) list of wines by the glass, and serve the best basket of bread around. One more bonus: for some reason, the restaurant draws an older, quieter crowd, which means that you can actually have an audible conversation there over lunch.",4,"Dined on November 4, 2011"

There were other service problems as well; but the food made up for it.",4,"Dined on September 18, 2011"

"The food was very good-rack of lamb, short ribs, salad, lobster and crab cake. We finished dinner around 10:30 and were told that if we wanted dessert we had to decide in 2 minutes because the kitchen was closing. We should have been informed of this a few minutes earlier. The scene was non-existent and I thought there would be one since it is on Waverly Place. It is an older crowd and very quiet but the food deserves its 23 on Zagat.",3,"Dined on September 3, 2011"

"We were very impressed by the attention to the details of our specific reservation.
My partner thoroughly enjoyed the Coriander Tuna as well as the Lobster Crab cakes which we shared. The Rosemary Herb Rack of Lamb which I had was quite tender and tasty.

4 of us had the restaurant week menu and found the portions more than ample. The tuna appetizer was delicious as was the heirloom tomato salad.

wonderful atmosphere in this restaurant attached to the hotel but also separate,4,"Dined on August 12, 2011"
"What a delightful place for dinner adjacent to the Washington Square Park! I had the fixed menu, and the beet soup was tasty and refreshing. The main course portion was on the small side, but for anyone ordering many courses, the size should be fine. The striped bass was moist and flaky, and perfectly paired with a polenta cake and grilled asparagus spears. The strawberry/rhubarb crumble was zesty, yet sweet; the tiny scoop of ice cream on top added a nice contrast. I look forward to visiting again.",4,"Dined on August 12, 2011"

Quiet restaurant on Washington Square Park with really good food at reasonable prices. Service inexplicably inconsistent for a small restaurant.,3,"Dined on August 4, 2011"
"North Square is a wonderful cozy restaurant nestled in its own quaters downstairs from the Washington Hotel. I've been going there about 10 years and each time I long to return. The ambiance is definately intelligencia Greewich Village -- writers, NYU professors, neighborhood professionals - overheard conversation is of current theater and novels, not Jersey Shore. A nice break!Appetizers including the lobster risotto and tuna tartare were light and delicious; our entrees, tuna from the ala carte menu and mussels were less than spectacular but that was offset by the sweet and savory key lime tart and great espresso. NorthSqaure alsways pleases and when you leave, you feel like you have had a very relaxing, adult night. Nice!",3,"Dined on August 4, 2011"

"Service was very good, as was the food. We ended up eating in the lounge as we had to increase our party from two to four and they could not accommodate the additional diners.

"Small but attractive restaurant in the heart of the west village with excellent food. Tasty lobster and crab cakes were followed by seared scallops -- only four but huge -- which were absolutely delicious. The spicy pumpkin creme brulee for dessert was the best creme brulee I've ever had. Friendly wait staff. It was very busy on a Saturday night but the noise level was never too high. You may have to wave down your waiter to get a saecond drink or glass of wine, but they are otherwise pretty attentive and you'll get that drink or wine rather quickly. All in all, very nice!",4,"Dined on April 24, 2011"
"This place was not at all as described from appetizer to entree it was the most bland food I have ever tasted. There wasn't any flavor and the scallops I had were as tough as shoe leather. The ambiance was not for quiet conversation because I could hardly hear across the table. This seemed to be a neighborhood spot that was for much elderly customers and wasn't a place for anyone who was under the age of fourty, unless your an old soul. The service was very slow and the wine list was just as disappointing.",1,"Dined on April 24, 2011"
"This was my second time dining at North Square. I came back because the first time was so good. This evening was equally as good! We had rack of lamb, roast duck, lobster risotto and a sausage plate. All perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. We sampled a cookie plate. Chewy flavorful gingerbread cookies were devine and I am not, a gingerbread fan. The wine list was had a good selection of new and old world wines.
The front room is small and cozy - beautiful flower arrangements on two sideboard tables - simple and sophisticated the rest of the room cozy. comfortable and elegant in a simple way. The back room has a bar and more tables - both are comfortable places in which to dine.",5,"Dined on April 24, 2011"
"I've been to North Square several years ago and had an amazing brunch so when my special someone's birthday and our anniversary approached, I thought this neighborhood gem would be perfect for the occasion. I was sadly disappointed. The waiter bought out the wrong appetizer, our water glasses were empty for most of the meal, and the check was miscalculated and additional charges were on the bill. They have many senior citizen regulars and the food is not bad. But the service was terrible especially when I specifically made it known that this was a very special occasion. Would I go again? Perhaps. But not for a special occasion.",2,"Dined on April 22, 2011"

"we walked in and walked right out. I thought I had landed in a city in the midwest in a restaurant with terrible decor, awful music -- just bad, bad atmosphere.

Peking duck breast and rack of lamb entrees were both cooked properly to desired doneness, and were delicious, as were accompanying fruit timbale and potato galette. Chocolate mousse cake and especially its accompanying bitter chocolate ice cream were fabulous. Nice, manageable wine list with good variety of medium priced selections.

"My girlfriend and I went during restaurant week and weren't overly impressed. We were seated at a small two-person table between two other duos. The location, combined with either a longer table or a longer booth made it difficult for us to hear each other speak. The apple/cauliflower soup was ok but not very flavorful, and the snapper was decent. The key lime pie was good, although it didn't seem unique. My girlfriend's chicken dish was much better than the snapper, and her banana cake was solid as well. All in all, though, I wouldn't recommend the food on the restaurant week menu, although this week's dishes look much better than what we had. Perhaps we just had a bad experience, but I'm not sure I would try it again soon.",2,"Dined on February 12, 2011"
The Restaurant Week options offered a nice selection and the food was excellent. The service timed everything just right and was never intrusive.,4,"Dined on February 12, 2011"

"Really appreciated that they included some nice wines at a ""restaurant week"" price as well as the food. My friends and I agreed that everything we ordered was well cooked and delicious. I'd go back for the endive salad alone. All of the staff was welcoming and paid good attention to our table, not just our excellent waitress. Other tables seemed to linger after the meal like we did. Not sure we could do that on a weekend night, but it was nice not to be rushed in any way. Very good place for conversation over a meal. Will absolutely return.",4,"Dined on February 8, 2011"
"Excellent visit! It was so crowded when we arrived; the hostess indicated our table would be ready in 5 minutes - and it was. We've had some inattentive servers, in past visits. This visit certainly changed that perception. Our server Joe was very engaging; helpful with assist in our selecting a bottle of wine. He checked in on us periodically (which hadn't always been our experience)- Scott and I appreciated that. Please thank the hostess (didn't catch her name), Joe, and the staff for making this a great visit. Oh, the rack of lamb was out-of-this-world! As was the accompanying potato/leek galette - capped off with a fabulous banana bread pudding. We'll be returning soon. Thank you!",5,"Dined on February 5, 2011"

"The ambiance was terrific. This is a nice find for people looking for a fine dining experience at a cost that's more affordable for those who are tight on cash. It's not a typical place for younger people to dine (the typical restaurant patron was over 50 years old, easily), but that did not seem to bother us (we are in our early 20s). The food was tremendous and was prepared quickly. The waitstaff was courteous and friendly throughout the duration of the meal.

"North Square turned out to be the perfect place for a blizzard dinner. Warm welcome, low key atmosphere, unobtrusive good service, and very good food. Starters were excellent -- lobster/crab cakes and mussels. For an entree, the char and rissoto blended together in a surprisingly nice way. The wine list is interesting, though it seemed a bit on the expensive side compared to the meal pricing. All in all, a very successful dinner.",4,"Dined on December 28, 2010"
"I've been going to this restaurant for five years and it's never disappointed. It has helped make Washington Square Hotel as fine a hotel as it has become.

"I've been to North Square a half dozen times in the past 2 years. The food is always delicious, and the service is always good. This time, a Saturday night between 5:30 and 8, service was less than stellar. When a restaurant expects to be busy, that's when I expect service to be good. No excuses. They're allowed one mistake. FYI, our party of five ate in the bar area.",3,"Dined on December 12, 2010"
"North Square is the kind of place you go if you live in the neighborhood and don't want to cook, but want to feel comfy and at home.

The wine list was varied and deep, although not totally up-to-date as the wine ordered ('06) was presented with a younger vintage ('07).

"This is the BEST restaurant in the west village.  The ambience is very attractive and even when all tables are filled the level of noise is very tolerable.  We eat here regularly, and when we have visitors this is the place we gravitate to.  My daughter and granddaughter say"" you can never get a bad meal at NORTH SQUARE.  The staff is attentive and pleasant neither  aggressive nor obsequious.  The menu changes seasonally but some favorites are always available.   There are not an excessive number of choices but good and broad representation.   We love the place.  Even had our Anniversary party/dinner here.  If this were  a Zagat review, I would say 26 , 26, 26 .",5,"Dined on November 18, 2010"

I was visiting NYC and taking a young woman on a date. I chose North Square because of the prior reviews of the restaurant. The atmosphere/environment was not all that romantic but the food more then made up for it. Everything my date and I was excellent.,4,"Dined on November 14, 2010"
"When Zagats said that North Square was one of the most under rated places in the city I knew I had to check it out. I have found it to be consistently wonderful with one of the friendliest, most attentive staffs I've encountered. The food is great and when they have it, the cilantro lime sorbet is incredible for dessert. The prices are incredibly reasonable for a place this nice and this good.",5,"Dined on November 14, 2010"

"North Square is a reliable and an excellent ""adult"" restaurant in Greenwich Village. The menu is limited, but one will find something of interest. I've dined there many times and the quality of the food is consistently very good. Service is also professional and pleasant. Decor is stylist, modern and upscale for the Village and a great spot to meet an old friend for lunch or to lunch with a business associate.

"We've been there before, quite a while ago, and really liked it alot. Partly because we had a fabulous young man as our server. This time we had a young woman who was indifferent, didn't know anything about the wine, was totally inattentive to us. She didn't seem to know much about the food either. We were not treated the way we were before. I doubt we'll come back. Too bad.",2,"Dined on October 21, 2010"
"The restaurant is in a great, vibrant neighborhood that we love, just off Washington Square Park. We appreciated the quiet setting for our group of four. The restaurant seems to attract a more ""mature"" customer. The hostess graciously let us switch to a table away from the door before the rest of our party came. Service was a little spotty, but the food was very good. Fillet mignon, shrimp bisque and chopped salad got rave reviews. Scallops, char and duck were good. The decor needs to be freshened up. The big floral bouquet in the room is a nice idea, but it look a bit tired when we were there; was it red carnations?
Next time I'll know to ask for a cozy spot in one of the banquettes along the wall.",3,"Dined on October 17, 2010"

"The food was good, nice presentation. But the waitress and service was slow. It was not too crowded when our party arrived and as the night went on it did become crowded. But when we'd put in an order of drinks it took a while to receive those drinks. The portions of food were small because it was more about the presentation.",2,"Dined on October 10, 2010"

"The host greeted us pleasantly. The restaurant had a record of our OpenTable reservation. We were seated promptly in the type of area that we requested. A number of people in my party felt that our waitress was brusque and inattentive. Our orders were delivered promptly. My companions enjoyed the lamburginis and oysters. I thought that the chicken quesadilla was unexceptional, though. My companions were not satisfied with the wines that were recommended.",3,"Dined on September 12, 2010"

"I felt that since I was a ""Restaurant Week"" diner, as opposed to a regular menu diner, I was treated very poorly, as if I were ""less important"" than the rest of their diners. I am certainly able to afford the regular menu, but the point is that I enjoy trying new restaurants and the promotion is a fun way to do so. We waited an extraordinarly long time between courses, and when I finally questioned the hostess she was very rude in her reply. After that little Q&A she become even more condescending and nasty for the rest of our stay. I would strongly recommend that North Square be removed from the list of choices. It was completely unacceptable. I have been to far nicer restaurants during this promotion and been treated much, much better.",1,"Dined on July 20, 2010"

Seafood is wonderful with nice light sauces and very well cooked side order like broccoli or creamed spinach. I was able to stick to a low glycemic diet very easily.

"The menu is very innovative with lots of good choices. You are able to change the vegetables if you'd like something from a different entree. I find this very desirable since there are foods I am not able to eat. I had the duck breast with roasted beets which was absolutely delicious, and my friends who had the pork tenderloin were very pleased. The ambience is lovely with fresh flowers and the richly painted tile pictures go very well with the wall color.

"The service was, overall, not satisfactory for this visit to North Square. Our waitress left mid-service, the hostess then doubling as server. We asked questions about a dessert, she repeated what was already on the menu. Then silence. Perhaps we should have asked her to consult with a more-knowledgeable server for more specifics?

And when we arrived on time, there were no tables available. Do they not check, nor honor Open Table online reservations?

The food was, as usual, quite wonderful. Perhaps this service was the exception to the usually reliable rule.",4,"Dined on March 27, 2010"

"I loved it so much the first time I went back the very next night with a friend and it lived up to the previous night's experience. I love the way they offer entrées and sides a la carte. That way I can get a steak and avoid the frites, substituting a cauliflower mash so I can keep the carbs way low. Pepper crusted filet mignon was perfectly cooked more flavorful than I've had in a long time. And the complimentary olives are out of this world, the best I've ever had. And I just had to indulge in the nicely varied bread basket, dipping tidbits in the very taste olive oil provided.",4,"Dined on March 17, 2010"

"Very nice food selection. I loved the sausage & cheese appetizer. The pork tenderloin was great, very tender and the sauce was very well done. The brownie sundae was a great dessert.

There was a very loud and obnoxious table next to us. Not the restaurant's fault as the rest of it seemed pretty quiet with small parties. But it did contribute to the noise level greatly. It's kind of a tight (but not small) space so any extra noise probably sounds louder than it really is.",4,"Dined on March 7, 2010"

Overly laid back service - wine wasn't left on the table, waiters preferring to serve throughout, but then we had to keep waiving for attention. Waiter also didn't feel the need to write down our order (it was the only intellectual stimulation he got in his day, he told us) but the wrong salad appeared initially for one of our party, so perhaps he brain wasn't quite up to the workout...",4,"Dined on February 22, 2010"

While somewhat attentive at first, our server disappeared after our entrees were brought out, and once we were finished our plates sat empty on our table for nearly 20 minutes.

"Had a wonderful experience. The staff was very accomodating after a slight mix up in a changed reservation they came thru with every effort to please. Food was lovely, great wine to choose from. A pretty restaurant.",4,"Dined on January 10, 2010"
"This casual restaurant is ALWAYS warm and welcoming, and seems to be a neighborhood favorite. There is a front entrance to the restaurant on the Northwest corner of Washington Square, and a side entrance which leads to the spacious bar/lounge in the rear. In addition to the usual menu and a prix fixe offering, the menu cleverly lists some ""a la carte"" entrees and sides so that you can customize your own meal. Happily, they also allowed us to bring our own wine (corkage fee $15). A delightful experience on all counts.",5,"Dined on January 10, 2010"
Love having hanger steak for brunch! Can't wait to go back and try the Pumpkin Pecan Pancakes! The ambiance was nice but you can still hear people having conversations a few tables away. I would still go back and eat there though!,4,"Dined on January 10, 2010"
"Things got better after our waiter immediately asked us for our food order when we hadn't looked at the menus, been offered drinks or even had water poured in our glasses.
Attractive, cozy restaurant with exposed brick walls and contemporary art. Very good food and decent wine list.",3,"Dined on January 9, 2010"
"Food was very good and prices were reasonable, but the restaurant was extremely quiet. Also our waitress seemed to disappear after serving dessert so we waited a while then finally asked the manager for our check. We did not see our waitress the last 30 minutes we were there, I found that very strange.",3,"Dined on January 2, 2010"

"Great spot for Xmas Eve, never made us feel rushed, server interacted wonderfully with all customers, remembered from our reservation that we had to be done by 8:30 and even brought us complementary beets when we couldn't decide between the sides! Special requests anticipated and acted upon by the server. Plan on at least $50 per person including tip, minus dessert. We were there for about 2 hours. Food was fabulous.",5,"Dined on December 25, 2009"
"food was good, somewhat marred by poor service. they weren't ready for us when we arrived, though restaurant was empty. We waited 20 minutes, and we finally went to find the host who said it would be a little while longer. No one offered us drinks or food, though we waited in the lounge, no one took our coats. When we got to our table, they couldn't find the bottle of wine we ordered, then it wasn't chilled enough. I expected more, particularly since it was an expensive meal.",3,"Dined on December 25, 2009"
"The restaurant was quite busy and crowded and we were seated in a corner over by the jazz group that was playing. The table was a bit small for three people and service not very attentive. It took a long time to get the check and there were very few tables still active, which just means that they were not paying attention. I have been here on other occasions with better service.",3,"Dined on December 20, 2009"
North Square is a reliable and very reasonably priced standby.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the food is good.  The service is only okay.  There must be a large turnover in personnel because we have been there many many times and no matter when we go we are always treated like we have never been there before.  They need to work on that.,3,"Dined on December 13, 2009"
"North Square is pleasantly dark, has delicous food and excellent service. I go there a lot for lunch and dinner and both meals are well-prepared and fresh. And NS is always(!) this way. There is very little variation in the quality of the food or service.",4,"Dined on December 12, 2009"

"We thought it was ""fine."" If I happened to be in the neighborhood, I would go there again, but I wouldn't go out of the way. I thought the combination of tastes in the dishes were very interesting, but execution was nothing special. The price at the end seemed very reasonable for the amount of food we had.",3,"Dined on December 6, 2009"

"North Square is one of the unheralded dining spots in NYC. The food is far better than its relatively modest prices would indicate, the service is always capable, friendly, and efficient, and the ambiance is warm and welcoming. The lounge is also a special place and worth checking out.",4,"Dined on November 30, 2009"
"The food was fantastic and the service was excellent. Quite honestly, that was what was important. As far as the atmosphere goes...there is none. It was very quiet and the patrons were mostly older but it was good food at a great value. And the prix fix was outstanding. So you can sacrifice one thing for the other.",4,"Dined on November 29, 2009"

The crab cakes and the tuna tartare appetizers were very good and were at a fair price.The bread and olives served before the meal were excellent. The yellowfin tuna entree and the ravioli were great. The service was good as well. My only concerns were with the decor and temperature of the restuarnt. The decor looked like a typical old Italian restaurant in NJ that needed a major update (only thing missing was the plastic plants). There were at least 3 different kinds of wallpaper and very eighties style pictures. Despite the outside temperature being about 50 degrees the restaurant pumped out the AC at max and several guests were wearing their winter jackets at the dinner tables-this should never happen!I would not return despite the food.,3,"Dined on November 15, 2009"
"I have been to this restaurant several times. This is the first time that both my husband and I were disappointed with the food. I ordered scallops as a main course and they were loaded with black pepper. The side dish of diced squash had red pepper on it. This was not indicated on the menu.
My husband's short rib was stringy.
Our two friends ordered pork tenderloin which they said was delicious. It looked juicy and was served with firm brussel sprouts.
I will try again as this is a neighborhood restaurant and the first time that they disappointed.",3,"Dined on November 13, 2009"
"A pleasant surprise. Very tasty food, decent service, extremely reasonable prices for the quality. Portions a bit too large for my taste but many would disagree. We were especially grateful for the $15 corkage, which allowed us to bring in an excellent bottle that we could never afford ordering from a restaurant wine list.",4,"Dined on November 12, 2009"
"We chose this restaurant based upon a solid review from Zagats and were not disappointed. We arrived at 5:30, the place was empty and we were immediately seated. Within half an hour it was much busier with many ""locals"" so the noise level escalated. Tables are about two feet apart which means you are listening to other conversations without meaning too. Our wait person seemed to be new and had to go into the ktichen every time we asked a question about an item. Menu was diverse enough to satisfy both of us. Food was well prepared and matched the description provided on the menu. We would have preferred better pacing since the main course arrived shortly after we finished the first course, but we lingered over desset.",3,"Dined on November 8, 2009"
"Basement restaurant. Great food. However, the ambiance and clientele is a bit 'dated' and 'retired'. It does not have much character -and could be a part of the Marriott.",3,"Dined on November 7, 2009"
"LOVED the food. The best olives I've ever had as a starter and it just got better (the olives are a proprietary recipe!). Went on to a roasted lobster over corn tamal, almond and red pepper salad, fennel cream. Excellent, could taste each element individually and the whole was sublime. Wait staff great - just don't let the bus people take your plate too soon!",5,"Dined on October 26, 2009"

By far the best steak I've ever had in my life, and my date said his fish was outstanding. Will definitely go back for that steak!",4,"Dined on October 11, 2009"
"North Square is a bit of an unlikely find. The room is small and L-shaped, below street level under the Washington Square Hotel. But we consider it a neighborhood treasure.

North Square is a consistent favorite. The food is delicious. I love the fish dishes especially and the wonderful sides that come with all the entrees such as cauliflower mash and garlicky greens. Last time I was there I had a key lime pie tart to die for. Also important to me is that you can actually have a conversation that does not involve shouting with your dining partners. The tables are spaced to provide privacy and the low ceiling keeps the noise level lively but not oppressive.,5,"Dined on September 11, 2009"

"A lovely space in a great, central location. The menu was quite appealing, with extensive offerings and an interesting way of offering the standard dishes but then offering the same food a la carte with sides so that diners can mix and match their sides with their mains. Everything was well presented, and the fish dishes we all ordered were well cooked, but, unfortunately, the flavors were not as appealing as I'd hoped. My spinach salad with mushrooms just didn't taste that good, and the side of spinach I ordered with the halibut wasn't flavorful. Desserts were quite good, particularly the chocolate mousse with caramel and Heath bar bits. Would return if someone else wanted to go, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to go again.",3,"Dined on August 27, 2009"

Definitely one of the more reliable places in this neighborhood, which goes a little too NYU-undergrad in general. Definitely would recommend this place.",4,"Dined on August 25, 2009"

"Although there are only 2 tables with any sort of ""view"", an after dinner walk through the square will suffice. We decided to try this place for restaurant week as the menu resembled those of the greats - arctic char, braised short ribs, scallops, risotto and tartar. And the general reaction was... nice try. It seemed as if the menu was just a little bit out of their league. Any flavors they tried to instill were not developed enough. The halibut and short ribs were underwhelming and boring. The horseradish mashed potatoes did not say horserasish at all. And the best part of the meal was the side of cauliflower mash. Plus the room felt like it should have been dressed up more. The dark wood tables felt publike. Nice staff though.",2,"Dined on July 17, 2009"
"Everything was fine but nothing was outstanding. My friend got the Restaurant Week menu and said his paella was dry. I ordered French fries that came out soggy. The server was friendly, but service in the restaurant overall seems like it could be a lot more professional. Both food and service could be kicked up a notch. On the plus side: prices were generally reasonable. I'd go again if I'm in the area but would not go out of my way to make a trip.",2,"Dined on July 16, 2009"
we went for restaurant week. the duck confit was tasty and the seafood paella was well seasoned. i was disappointed in the red velvet cake--way too dry. the caramel and bananas that accompanied the dessert were the best thing on the dessert plate.,3,"Dined on July 15, 2009"
"North Square is a great neighborhood restaurant with excellent food and service. The salads (in particular the chopped salad and the endive salad) are excellent appetizers. The menu has something for everyone (regular entrees, ala carte, prix fixe) and is regularly changed so it never gets old. There are always a number of fish and seafood options. The lobster and scallops are very good. The long island duck, chicken and filet mignon entrees are good choices too. Desserts are inventive (I like the black and white sundae in particular). Prices are reasonable and represent good value. The bar is well stocked and a great place for a quiet conversation. The bar menu is also a good option (specifically the burger and polenta sticks).",5,"Dined on July 12, 2009"

The menu is eclectic, and there isn't any one dish that I would describe as fabulous, but everything that I or my tablemates have ever ordered has been well-prepared and very tasty, usually with some nice, original touches. I could eat the tuna tartare everyday (though probably not a good idea, given health warnings about excessive consumption of raw tuna), and I love the arugula salad with figs. There's always an interesting (and changing) list of wines by the glass, and the bread basket is outstanding. I also like the art deco decor.

"A quiet neighborhood find, that's North Square. No tourists, no scene, just deliciously prepared simple favorites: mashed potatoes! Steak au poivre! And a very nice wine list. And, if you order wine by the glass, they come by and pour it from a real bottle. There are booths, and beautiful flowers, and nice art on the walls. Terrific. Since discovering North Square about 2 years ago, we always go there when in the area.",4,"Dined on February 13, 2009"
"The food was fantastic. Every dish was beautifully presented and delicious. I ate too much, including a fantastic chocolate chip bread pudding with pistachio ice cream and caramalized bananas.

"The service was friendly and very helpful. The food was well portioned, attractive and we both enjoyed our soups, oysters and entres. The wine list is interesting, varied and affordable -- they are currently featuring a number of burgundies. The white we tried was light, dry and went well with our first courses as described. The sunken room was cozy and inviting. It is a place we'll return often, especially because it is a perfect place for breakfast with a menu to match. Charming.",5,"Dined on February 7, 2009"

"A real surprise. We wanted something in the neighborhood for our friend's birthday dinner, and this turned out to be just great. Food was excellent all around; we ordered a variety of appetizers, entrees and desserts (there were five of us), and everything was delicious and well presented. Lively but not deafening crowd, and good location (inside lobby of Washington Square Hotel). A real winner, very friendly and helpful service, we will definitely return.",4,"Dined on January 28, 2009"
"We dined here for Restaurant week. I really enjoyed my potato crusted halibut, and my husband loved his BBQ braised short rib. The pumpkin goat cheese ravioli appetizer was interesting but good. I thought it was a great feature that they had a restaurant week wine list as well- all in all, we had 3 courses each, a bottle of a nice portuguese red and spent about 120,including tip, which was really decent all things considered. The dessert choices were delicious- we shared a lime-coconut flan and chocolate mousse cake. I'd opt for the flan as a lighter, less dense choice. My only criticism was it was so cold in the dining room, I wanted to wear my jacket! The lounge was warmer- opt to eat in the lounge, it has more spunk and personality.",4,"Dined on January 24, 2009"

"Food was delicious. The only two problems we had with North Square were that being New Year's Eve, some parents brought children and they were loud - not an environment for celebrating with adults. There should have been more of a separate area for families. Secondly, the cold weather that night brought the cold, windy weather onto our table each time the door opened.",3,"Dined on January 1, 2009"

"I'll admit this place wasn't hands-down knock-your-socks-off amazing, but it was extremely good for the prices we paid. My husband and I shared the duck quesadilla, which was delicious, then he ordered the short rib which was succulently delightful, and I ordered the Halibut with dill veloute - also tasty, although nothing incredibly out of the ordinary. We ordered the side of wild mushrooms, which I loved because they weren't overly drenched in oil, and a side of the seaweed and cucumber salad, which was very tasty but there wasn't a lot of seaweed. We also ordered a bottle of one of the Piedmont wines they were offering that night for 50% off, and we walked out of there with a bill of just over $80!! Definitely worth checking it out!",3,"Dined on December 14, 2008"

The 7-grain stuffing was, frankly, quite odd. Traditional or a variation of bread stuffing would have been more welcome. But we generally love our dinners at North Square.",4,"Dined on November 28, 2008"

"You know how most people have a restaurant they think of like a 'kitchen' in their own neighborhood? This place is like having a 'kitchen' in a different part of town.  Small, quiet, they always have great bistro standards (a very nice roast chicken), and a good wine list.  Gorgeous flowers, too. It's in a (very small) hotel right on Washington Square.  Your fellow diners will sometimes be hotel guests:  very quiet, some alone. Not a 'destination' restaurant, but good for when you want a simple meal, and happen to be in the nabe. Get a booth.",4,"Dined on October 1, 2008"

"I have dined at North Square on quite a few occasions and always found it to be a pleasurable experience.  This all changed on Sunday, 9/21/2008.  I used Open Table to schedule a brunch with friends.  The hostess was most friendly.  The waiter largely ignored us - barely refilling beverages, and only after multiple requests.  I was actually embarrassed by the quality of the food.  The french toast was a soggy mess of bread.  The pumpkin pancakes were hardly palatable. The fruit salad, home fries, and bacon were good.  We couldn't get out of there fast enough.",2,"Dined on September 21, 2008"

"I love this restaurant, but I mainly go there for lunch.  This is the first time I've gone with my whole family (including two picky young-adult eaters), and everyone had a great meal.  And the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food.  The kitchen is sometimes a little slow, but the service is very attentive.  The average age of the diners in the evening is quite a bit higher than at lunch, but I think that indicates that wisdom grows with age and it means that the restaurant is actually quiet enough for a meaningful conversation.",4,"Dined on September 1, 2008"

Due to the last minute nature of my task I thought I would see if Open Table could help.  Yes, they did!  I was looking for a restaurant downtown, good food and not extremly pricey.  North Square met all those requirements.  I thank Open Table reviews for helping me find this great restaurant that we will definately return to.

"Small and unpretentious, North Square delivers solidly on food, service, atmosphere and initial welcome at the door. We came during restaurant week and were delighted with the prix fixe menu; beet soup smooth as velvet; grilled char cooked exactly the way we'd requested, barbecued ribs so tender they literally fell off trhe bone.

"In Manhattan people choose restaurants for many different reasons.  Some choose the newest or hottest.  We go for overall quality on a holistic level. Service, food, atmosphere, neighborhood etc.  Though we have been to nearly all of the hot and premiere restaurants in the city, we, and our out of town visitors have found North Square to be our favorite restaurant in Manhattan. 

The service is genuine, warm and professional, the food is consitently great.  The decor is not a draw for us, but we hear it is going to be renovated.  Nonetheless, the atmosphere is casually elegant.  We have become regulars, and are treated as such.

I was disappointed to find that we couldn't hear the music from our table, and the band wasn't playing in the restaurant- they were playing elsewhere(probably in the hotel lobby or bar), and to add insult to injury- our server took our order then disappeared.

If the staff dressed more professionally (better attire, no piercings) then the place could be taken more seriously.
A place like this should NOT ALLOW patrons to dine in sneakers & jeans. THis should be prohibited if it wants to be a cut above the rest.

"Brunch here is consistently great. Kitchen really knows how to make food well. It's my top pick for brunch. Dinner has been good, too.",4,"Dined on April 12, 2008"
"My friend and I really enjoyed our brunch at North Square.  The food was delicious, the decor is great, and it was crowded enough that you were comfortable that the food was fresh, but there wasn't any wait. I highly recommend!",4,"Dined on April 12, 2008"
"My husband and I have been having brunch at North Square for years (and before when it was C3) and this was the first dinner we had there. Delicious crab lobster cakes, excellent wine, and quiet for good conversation.  It's a neighborhood favorite for us.",4,"Dined on April 11, 2008"
"consistently excellent food and wine
professional staff",4,"Dined on April 9, 2008"
DELICIOUS!,4,"Dined on April 7, 2008"
Really nice affordable menu. The manager was clearly trying to keep on top of things and the food was all consistently good. Only gripe was when I paid in cash with 80 dollars for a 64 dollar tab and I had to ask the waiter to give me change after he tried to pocket the 18 dollars...big no no!!,4,"Dined on April 6, 2008"
A surprising find in the village. Don't tell anyone.,3,"Dined on April 5, 2008"
"It was a decent restaurant at reasonable prices. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there since we live uptown, but if I had a reason to be in that area, I would go there again.",3,"Dined on April 4, 2008"
Always good value for money and much less pressured than most Village restaurants.,3,"Dined on April 4, 2008"
Decent place for comfort food with a twist.,3,"Dined on March 30, 2008"
"A nice little restaurant with a lovely location right by Washington Square Park.  The menu was not extensive. We went at 2:30 and were more prepared for lunch, so all the egg and breakfast options did not sound appealing to us, which did not leave many options.  The fish however, although small, was delicious.",3,"Dined on March 29, 2008"
"North Square 's food is superior. I defy anyone to  discover a better chopped salad, or seared tuna. I only mention those two selections because I love them but my husband and friends who dine with me will equally defend their choices as vehemently.
The meal is that special!
I only wish that the service were a bit more attentive. One gets the feeling that the policy is more about just bringing food to table and then becoming scarce. No one really comes back to inquire about particular needs.
You must be a bit aggressive to get a server to come over for desert , more coffee, or to bring check.
This, however is a minor criticism given how spectacular the dining experience is.
I highly recommend  North Square every chance I get.",5,"Dined on March 29, 2008"
"This was my second time dining there and I thought that the food and ambiance were great.
The prices were very good ,too. The food was plentiful and well prepared.",5,"Dined on March 26, 2008"
"Part of our party got lost and they seated us anyway(the others were 30 minutes late). The waiter really had to put up with our shenanigans and he was so kind and professional. Even though we ordered at different times he got all of the food to the table at once properly heated etc. We stayed a long time(our reservation was for (9:00PM on a Saturday  night and they never rushed us), we will definitely come again the Sunday brunch looks like a good deal.",5,"Dined on March 23, 2008"
"Service was exemplary, very friendly and attentive.",4,"Dined on March 23, 2008"
it's a pleasure to see a wine list that is not only well composed but fairly priced.,4,"Dined on March 23, 2008"
Sort of like a V8.  One of those restaurants that you sometimes forget about...but when you return...you say I should have been coming here more often.,3,"Dined on March 22, 2008"
Very good food nicely preared.,4,"Dined on March 17, 2008"
"Sat in a booth.  Disappointed in that.  Food was just ok, nothing special.  Bathrooms were small.",2,"Dined on March 16, 2008"
"A reliable spot for neighborhood dining, business lunches. Consistently tasty food with occasional flashes of brilliance. Great entree salads. Good wines by the glass.",3,"Dined on March 5, 2008"
"Our visit here was, quite frankly, one of the best meal and restaurant experiences we've had in NYC quite some time. North Square is warm & friendly. I ordered the melt-in-your-mouth Tortilla-Crusted Snapper and Pecan Pie Triangle with Chocolate Sorbet. Our server was absolutely adorable…overall, a fantastic experience.",5,"Dined on August 19, 2007"
