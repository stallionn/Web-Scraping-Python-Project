The food is consistently good, it is reasonably priced and we could always count on it for an enjoyable dinner out.  However, the last few times we have been here, there has been a noticeable issue with service.  At our last visit, we were seated for 20 minutes before anyone came over and asked about drinks or food order (and this was only after my husband went up to the bar to inquire).  Two women sitting by us had a similar experience, albeit an even longer time without service.  This has happened a few times now and at first we attributed it to newer staff post COVID but enough time has passed for adequate training.  The food remains reliable so we will give it a few more chances but I  do hope that management can improve the service with either new or additional staffing.  It's a solid neighborhood place so it would be a shame if we had to stop dining here.",

            "analysis": "I would classify this review as 'negative' with a neutral inclination. Here's why:\n\nThe review starts off positively, mentioning that North Square has been a favorite neighborhood spot for several years and that the food is consistently good and reasonably priced. This suggests a positive impression of the restaurant.\n\nHowever, the review takes a turn when the writer describes the disappointing service they experienced at their last few visits. They mention specific problems, such as long waits for service and staff not coming over to take orders, and attribute it to a lack of adequate training. This is a significant criticism of the restaurant's service.\n\nAlthough the writer expresses hope that the service will improve and says they are willing to give the restaurant a few more chances, the negative comments about service outweigh the positive ones. The reviewer's choice to give the restaurant a 4-star rating instead of a lower rating suggests that the good aspects of their experience (food quality and price) were not enough to overcome the poor service.\n\nOverall, while the review is not uniformly negative, the negative comments about service dominate the sentiment, making it a negative review overall."

We appreciated not being rushed to depart once the set had ended…we could enjoy our coffee and conversation.",

I love his lamb burger with homemade pickles, his calamari with its special tangy sauce, his eggs McDougal with spinach and smoked salmon, his caesar kale salad with mini croustades serving as croutons...I could go on. Suffice to say Chef Yoel's special touch makes North Square a must for dining in the Big Apple.",

They mention the meal was \"delicious\" and they enjoyed their specific dish (grain bowl) and cocktail (Sidecar). Although they mention the acoustics are not good and it got noisy later in the night, they don't let that overshadow their positive experience.

Inside, you feel transported to another time and place, away from the hustle and bustle of NYC in a semi-subterranean hideaway a few steps below sidewalk level at the northwest corner of Washington Square Park. The bar lounge, tucked away behind a door in the rear of the restaurant, is intimate and comfortable. The service is impeccable, the food is four-star, the plate presentation is artful and the vibe is relaxed. A truly special place in a special part of downtown Manhattan.",

Additionally, the reviewer highlights the restaurant's consistency, stating that they have been doing things correctly for over 30 years, which adds to the positive tone. The only aspect of the review that might seem neutral is the phrase \"uncharacteristically (for Manhattan)\", but it's used to highlight the rarity of finding a quiet spot in Manhattan, which in itself is a positive observation.

The wait staff, likewise, is friendly, helpful, and really offer a big assist helping the customers pick out their main course - i.e., something that you will like and something you believe will amount to a delicious dinner at a value price.\nThe food itself is very good, whether meat, fish, pasta.  The dinner plate sizes are just right and are roomy enough to provide for a tasty, very good meal at a decent price.     \nThere's no rushing the customer at North Square.  Waiters and other staff are clearly on the lookout to remove plates when customers finish each course, but they're not hovering over each customer to see them finish a course.\nBesides offering a variety of meals at decent prices,  the restaurant is busy but yet quiet enough to have pleasant across-the-table conversation.  For me, the restaurant offers the right mix of food and ambiance - and that's what most of us are looking for when having a pleasant dinner with friends or colleagues\nGive this place a try and you may well become a repeat customer too, like me.",

In fact, you could be in \"Anywhere, USA\".  But don't let the decor put you off. \n\nI've eaten there a few times and the food is always excellent.  2 of us had arctic char, which was prepared perfectly: moist, with a crunch skin.  One person at the table orders duck wherever she goes, and she couldn't say enough about how delicious it was there.  The birthday boy had rack of lamb, which he had eaten there many times before, and he loved it.  Someone else had salmon, and she likes it almost completely raw.  She complains constantly at restaurants that it isn't rare enough, but they got it right.  The servers are attentive to requests and they don't get it wrong.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the noise level is low and everyone can hear everyone else.  I'm tired of straining my voice in restaurants.  I suppose the noise level at so many NYC restaurants  is supposed to give it a festive mood, but I strain my voice enough in my work; I don't like to fight ambient noise when I'm eating.  I'm young, but 2 members of our party were older, and noisy restaurants just don't work for them.  The volume at this place is perfect.\n\nObviously, it's not a secret in the neighborhood.  The place appears to have a lot of loyal locals, many of whom look liked they've lived in the area for a long time.  I suppose there are some people from the hotel that houses the restaurant.  But, mostly, it seemed to be people like us who wanted to eat a delicious dinner, celebrate a birthday (there was another birthday at a table nearby) and enjoy the company of their friends/family without all the noise.\n\nWe are becoming regulars.",

We were staying at the Washington Square Hotel and needed someplace close for dinner, but were worried because sometimes hotels don't have the best eateries . We noticed right away that everyone who came in was a local and appeared to eat there regularly, and we saw why. The crab and corn salad was perfectly seasoned and very fresh. The rack of lamb with its dusting of parsley/mint/herbs, which were finely grated, was a divine flavor combination. Since I always order my meat medium rare, I was super happy to find a chef who REALLY knows how to do that properly (perfectly pink inside, crusty on the outside and hot all the way through!) The AuGratin potato accompaniment was also beautifully prepared with delicate, yet amazing flavor. Lastly, the creme brûlée was prepared with roasted coconut- unexpected and delicious!! We will definitely eat here again!",

Desserts likewise were good, not outstanding.  Neighboring tables were too noisy, but they departed about 1/2 hour after we ordered.  All in all for a busy NYC restaurant the entrees and service were excellent, and everything else was good. In all, the meals seemed to be good value too - reasonable prices for the most part. We've been there before and we shall definitely return.",

Here's a brief reason:\n\nThe reviewer highlights several instances of excellent service, describing the waitress as \"friendly, patient, and helpful\". They also mention that all 4 of their dinner entries were \"delicious\" and \"outstanding\", which indicates a high level of satisfaction with the food. Although they mention some minor flaws, such as noisy neighboring tables and good-but-not-outstanding wines and desserts, they frame these issues as relatively minor compared to the overall excellent service and food quality. The reviewer also mentions that they've been to the restaurant before and will definitely return, which indicates a strong likelihood of doing business with the establishment again. Overall, the review has a balanced tone, but the positive comments and praise outweigh the minor criticisms, making it a positive review."

Many years ago, someone snatched it up, cleared it out and made it a little NYC gem, a stellar boutique hotel that includes this delightful dining spot, North Square.  It's a place where normal people eat. And that doesn't mean \"old\" or \"out of touch.\"  Just people who love good food, don't read their e-mails while dining, respond to the warmth and knowledge of its waitstaff, the lovely wine list,  un-shocking prices--and just damned good food, superbly prepared and served on time.  I have brought several people from out of town here who request that we return when they visit again. And you don't have to call 30 days in advance for a reservation. A true little treasure just across from Washington Square Park which, despite greedy developers, remains intact and beautiful. If you're after a completely lovely evening, here it is.",

I was extremely pleased when our waiter topped off my second glass of wine as a courtesy when he saw that it was gone and I had not finished my meal. He gave me a little extra--I thought that was terrific. It's little things like that that would incline me to come back to the restaurant. It's NYC and the truth is, there are a lot of upscale great restaurants. Great, welcoming service is harder to find, in my opinion. Oh and I forgot--when ordering wine by the glass we were given a chance to taste it first and say yes or no. I've never seen that before. Food and service and ambiance were all outstanding.",

The menu was varied enough that everyone found something to suit their taste and we all enjoyed our meals, steak, halibut, pork and we all had dessert too.  It was wonderful to be able to have a conversation without having to shout.  And the price was very reasonable also and the service very professional. It was just what we were looking for.",

When we arrived we realized that the restaurant is attached to a hotel. The ambience was pretty plan, nothing too special about the decor. The food we had was tasty and well done. There were lots of options and pre-fixe meals. We weren't blown away by anything so wouldn't rush back but if you are staying in the area, it is a good place to go for a meal.",

My friend had the fish special which was moist and not overcooked as  has happened on occasion in other restaurants.  We were very pleased with the main courses.  For desert, we ordered the platter of cookies which was a nice assortment of chocolate and other flavors.  It was more than enough for two but so good we finished all of them.

                "Review": "Nicely done for first week of restaurant week.  Unlike some other restuarants this one puts THREE separate menus in place, one for each week.  We went for the first of the three, which was the least quirky menu, with mostly winter comfort foods on the list.  Nicely limited menu, with just the right kind of variety.  The appetizer of gnocchi with a variety of flavorings was really a sort of Asian-Mexican-American Fusion dish.  The New England Clam Chowder was a leek and potato based soup, rather than an overly cream-based-artery clogger.  The broth contain a number of large plump clams, which inspires the kid in your brain with treasure hunt anticipation.  Pork rib-eye was perfectly done comfort food, with one outstanding quality.  This was the most tender perfectly cooked pork chop I've ever eaten, and I've had a few.  Another stand out, the coffee Crème Brule was the most generous such desert size I've yet seen.  This is especially nice for sharing.  The pricing for restaurant week wasn't an outrageous bargain; essentially you get the desert for free.  But on the plus side, at $3.00 a cup, this restaurant also doesn't rip you off for $5.00 for a cup of tea or coffee, as many do. \n\nThe crowd was an odd mix of aging dowagers, just barely doddering into their seats, left-over Village hippie era retirees, who likely live in the area and won't give up their Brownstones until they are dead, maybe even not then (their kids will inherit them), and a few youngish loved-up couples on a romantic date.  \n\nService was attentive and pleasant, just right, despite the place being busy on a Thursday night.  The flow was impressive.  Tables would empty and fill right up again, so the reservation scheduling was clearly seamless and well done - and required if you want to get a table on a busy evening.",

In fact, it smelled like hotel breakfast (coffee, etc). No one other than us was under the age of 65 on a weeknight. No complaints about the service. The food was just okay. Crostini's missed the mark...none of the flavor profiles really went together and duck confit was poor quality. Tuna tartare was okay, but I didn't like the combination of all the diced raw veggies in it. The fish quality was good, though. For mains, the duck was okay, but had an over-fried spring roll and random black beans on top. My date had the lamb which was pretty good. I don't want to dog the restaurant, it wasn't bad, but it was just small and hotel-ish and the food was not outstanding. I think if I knew that going in, I would have had different expectations.

They also mention that their companion's pancakes were \"wonderful\", which further reinforces the positive tone.\n\nHowever, the review takes a turn when the reviewer expresses disappointment with their own dish, the \"creative\" take on the Cobb salad. They list several changes that they didn't like, including the absence of dressing, egg, and crisp bacon, and the use of iceberg lettuce instead of something else. This criticism is specific and detailed, and suggests that the reviewer was not satisfied with their meal.\n\nThe review ends by mentioning that the ambiance \"continued to be its pleasant self\", which suggests that the restaurant's atmosphere was still pleasant, at least.\n\nOverall, while the review has both positive and negative elements, the negative comments are more specific and detailed, which gives them more weight. However, the reviewer does not use strong language to express their dissatisfaction, and they do not say that they will never return to the restaurant again, which suggests that they may still have a positive overall impression of the place."

The reviewer even goes so far as to say that the food was \"none very special\", which reinforces the idea that the food was not memorable or noteworthy.\n\nThe fact that the reviewer gave the restaurant a rating of 3 out of 5 also supports the idea that their overall experience was negative. A rating of 3 suggests that the reviewer was somewhat discontent, but not entirely unhappy with their experience."

                "Review": "We opted for a late lunch and had a window seat with a few other tables finishing their meals when we arrived. Our first impression was not all that positive. First of all, the hostess needs a personality. She half heartedly, and without so much as a smile, offered seating options in a wide open dining room. My companion was taking a phone call in the vestibule and while there had to assist elderly patrons to exit the restaurant. All the while the hostess looked on without lifting a finger or afterwards so much as offering a thank you for assisting.  Fortunately the dining experience improved. Our waiter was generally attentive, courteous and efficient. We had the crab cakes, a pork porterhouse sandwich and a duck confit salad and two glasses of wine. What I loved was the fresh ingredients and the mostly salad and veggie accompaniments vs. French fries, rice, and potatoes. The crab cakes were particularly notable but could be improve with a bit of citrus based accompaniment, even a bit more of the existing accompaniment would have improved what was a good choice. The Duck Confit salad was also good but the duck bits were a bit flat in flavor and changing this would make an otherwise good salad into a great salad. The pork sandwich was perhaps the disappointment of the meal as it sounded great on paper but was a bit lackluster in flavor. I am not sure if it is a function of the need to appeal to a wide range of palates why some of the flavors were so muted or if it was a function of our seating being close to the end of the lunch service. Getting our check seemed to be a deer in headlights inspiring experience for the staff member whom we had to draw away from some screen at the hostess station; she seemed visibly annoyed at having to do anything for the restaurant’s guests. Finally we virtually showed ourselves out without a departing thank you while the staff congregated in the rear.",

The reviewer also mentions that the hostess didn't even offer a thank you. Although the reviewer praises the fresh ingredients and attentive waiter, the meal itself receives mixed reviews. The crab cakes and duck confit salad were good, but the pork sandwich was a disappointment due to its lack of flavor.

We noticed once in the restaurant that the entrance to the restaurant is on McDougal, around the corner from Waverly Place.\nThe atmosphere was cozy. Our waiter gave us a choice of table and we enjoyed a nice dinner.\nFor appetizer we had fried calamari with a small side of slightly spicy tomato sauce which was good. For entree we had roasted duck and grilled red snapper over a bed of vegetables. Both entrees were delicious.

My friends all had oysters (I can't comment, but they seemed happy) and then a few apps.  I know the tuna tartare was delicious.  My mushroom ravioli thing was fine, although I was jealous of the tuna app, and regretted not having ordered the butter/radicchio salad w/cheese that I had considered, once I tasted that.  Several of us had the steak, which was tender and buttery, and for me that more than made up for the excess of pepper in my first bite.  But I'm not a huge pepper fan, and I much preferred the mustard that came on the side  (and the big fat steak fries were just the way I like them).   My friend was very happy with her duck entree and we shared some desserts but I was so full at that point I only had a bite or two.   We were all full but the desserts were finished.   Oh, the Sancerre by the glass was excellent.  Not inexpensive overall ($300 for 5 including 2 bottles of wine, before tip),  but a great location and WONDERFUL service.  Definitely recommend.",

However, they also mention some negative aspects, specifically that the decor \"looks a little dated\" and the atmosphere is not entirely impressive (the downstairs area is only described as \"cozy\", which is a somewhat neutral adjective). Additionally, the rating of 3 out of 5 stars suggests that the reviewer was not overly impressed.\n\nSo while the review is not strictly negative, it's not entirely positive either. It's a mixed bag of opinions, and the reviewer's lukewarm rating suggests that they didn't have a particularly strong positive or negative reaction to their experience."

I had the filet au poivre and frites. It was prepared perfectly and the au jus was so tasty. It came with roasted Vidalia onions which I gobbled up because I am a fool for Vidalias. The potatoes were so-so but didn't detract greatly from the meal. I wish I had room for dessert since the selections looked wonderful.",

The rack of lamb was perfectly seasoned, pink inside, just as it should be. Potato galette was also perfect: full of flavor, not heavy of fatty. My dining companion had the short ribs -- absolutely no fat (not easy with short ribs), in a richly flavored sauce with ancho chili and other mysterious flavors -- cinnamon? Delicious.\nBest of all: it's quiet! You can hear whoever is on the other side of the table and have a conversation. Music is muted classic jazz, staff is friendly, relaxed and efficient.",

They then specifically highlight two dishes as exceptional: \"the scallops on the brunch menu were divine\" and \"the apple cranberry crisp with vanilla ice cream was just right\". This suggests that the reviewer was thoroughly impressed with the food. Finally, they express their overall satisfaction by saying \"I loved it and can't stop raving about it\", which indicates a strong emotional response.\n\nThe 5-star rating also reinforces the positive sentiment, as it is the highest possible rating."

People who'd been seated before us still had their menus. Others, who arrived after we did, left without ordering. Once our order was finally placed, there was another wait, but a variety of delicious breads and mini-muffins helped quell the hunger pangs. When our entrees finally arrived, the food was nicely presented, delicious (both meals) and reasonably priced. I blame the owner or manger or whoever didn't ensure proper staffing for the busy Saturday lunch crowd, not our valiant server. I hope it was an anomaly. I'd definitely give it another chance based on the food alone.",

Although the restaurant wasn't croweded, we sat for half an hour before anyone showed up to move beyond the \"Here are your menus\" stage, and we were only able to place our order (for drinks *and* dinner, as a precaution) after hailing the hostess and asking her to find someone. Entrees also took too long to arrive, and the meal itself was uneven: kale salad with apples and buttermilk dressing was plentiful and delicious, the duck breast was succulent, the sauteed halibut was dry and flavorless and the vegetable accompaniments were brown and blandly prepared. The place is pretty, tables are well-spaced, but I doubt we'll be going back.",

Our table was tucked into a corner (which we liked), but it was nearly impossible to get the attention of a waiter, or busboy... or anyone, for that matter. The vibe was one of casual indifference. North Square lacked a soul -- there was no staff member that seemed happy enough to be serving diners, or really be bothered with any of the aspects of running a restaurant. It is a shame, since the location is great, the food is decent, and the ambience is pleasant. THis was one dining experience where the inattention and general maiaise of the staff had a negative effect on the whole night out.",

We were seated in the lounge only two tables away from the Jazz group of the day, a Jazz vocalist with a guitar and upright bass accompaniment. The service was excellent and our drinks and food came almost instantly. They were very understanding when the fourth member of our party arrived late, and did not give us a hard time. Also they did not rush us out after we had finished our food. Overall wonderful food, we all got the brunch sampler and comfortable/warm ambiance.",

My wife and I were both very impressed with the food and even more impressed with the bill. We both had appetizers - a salad for her, tuna sashimi for me, which were very good. And the main courses - tuna steak for her, seared scallops for me - were both excellent. Service was very friendly but not overbearing and timing of courses was perfect. Total bill with tax and tip (neither of us had drinks) was $75. Really and excellent experience.",

Traveled two hours from LI this time, and asked a collegue from abroad to join my husband and me for brunch. I wish we had gone to the diner instead!!! The omelets were over-cooked, the salad had wilted from the heat lamps (or something) and the home-fries were tasteless. I should have sent it all back. I was hoping for a nice, perfect omelet, based on my previous experience at North Square, but no. The bread was good, but I would guess, left over from dinner the night before. I will never go back.",

Here's why:\n\nThe reviewer starts by mentioning a previous positive experience at North Square, which suggests that they had high expectations going into this visit. However, the majority of the review is focused on the negative aspects of their experience. The reviewer describes the food as poor quality, stating that the omelets were over-cooked, the salad was wilted, and the home-fries were tasteless. They also mention that the bread was likely left over from the previous night's dinner, which implies that there was a lack of attention to detail.\n\nThe reviewer's tone is also critical, as evidenced by their statement that they \"wish they had gone to the diner instead\" and that they \"will never go back\". The reviewer's rating of 3 out of 5 stars suggests that they were not completely dissatisfied, but the overall tone of the review is decidedly negative."

The seating arrangement, once we were sitting, was such that I was elbowed in the head every 20 minutes by a waiter. There were about 45 minutes between each of the courses. What's better than waiting forever for food that is less than mediocre? Then there's the decor/ambience --- the odd IHOP-like lighting, the no music, the cramped seating. There was nothing positive about the experience here.",

After we were seated, we waited quite some time for our server to take drink orders. When I asked if there were any specialty cocktails, she disappeared for another long stretch, came back with a cocktail list and vanished again. When we finally got to order, we learned that one of our drinks (a very standard order) could not be made as the bar had run out of stock. Our server, while pleasant enough, seemed unfamiliar with the menu and rather bewildered in general. That said, I would try North Square again on a non-holiday in the hope that the service might compare to the food",

The review begins by mentioning a positive experience with the Thanksgiving prix-fixe menu, stating that it offered great variety at a moderate price and that the food was \"quite good\" to \"excellent\". However, the reviewer then expresses disappointment with the service, citing long wait times, a server who seemed unfamiliar with the menu, and a lack of specialty cocktails. The reviewer's overall rating is 3 out of 5, which further supports the idea that the review is mixed.\n\nHowever, if I had to lean towards a classification, I would say that the overall sentiment is slightly more negative than positive, as the reviewer's criticisms of the service seem more detailed and prominent than their praise for the food."

I'd rather eat here than its pricier, \"celebrity\" neighbor across the street - Babbo - and I've dined there too.",

However, the use of the phrase \"felt like a hotel restaurant in a time warp from the '80's\" and \"a little quiet\" (referring to the bar) convey a sense of disappointment and underwhelm. The reviewer's tone is not entirely negative, but the criticisms they raise have a greater impact on their overall rating (3 out of 5) and sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the reviewer specifies that it was a Friday, which suggests that their experience might not be relevant to a busier evening or a different day of the week."

We decided to try this place for restaurant week as the menu resembled those of the greats - arctic char, braised short ribs, scallops, risotto and tartar. And the general reaction was... nice try. It seemed as if the menu was just a little bit out of their league. Any flavors they tried to instill were not developed enough. The halibut and short ribs were underwhelming and boring. The horseradish mashed potatoes did not say horserasish at all. And the best part of the meal was the side of cauliflower mash. Plus the room felt like it should have been dressed up more. The dark wood tables felt publike. Nice staff though.",

The reviewer praises the value of the restaurant, stating that it's a \"great quality for the price\", implying that they felt they got a good deal.\n3. The tone of the review is upbeat and encouraging, with phrases like \"This Place should be packed every night\" and \"Definitely a great restaurant!\", which suggest that the reviewer is confident and satisfied with their experience.\n\nThe only potential caveat is the reviewer's comment that the restaurant \"should be packed every night\", which could be interpreted as a subtle criticism that it's not as busy as it should be. However, this is a minor quibble compared to the overwhelming tone of positivity and enthusiasm in the review. Overall, the reviewer's glowing praise and high rating (5 out of 5 stars) indicate a strong positive sentiment."

They describe the food as \"solidly\" delivered, and specifically highlight several dishes as exceptional, including the beet soup and grilled char. They also mention that the service, atmosphere, and initial welcome were all good. Additionally, they express enthusiasm for the prix fixe menu and the discount coupon they were given, stating that they will \"be sure to use\" it. The only minor criticism is that the review is brief and doesn't provide many specifics about the restaurant, which might explain the 4-star rating rather than a 5-star rating. Overall, the tone of the review is upbeat and celebratory, with more praise than criticism."

After that little Q&A she become even more condescending and nasty for the rest of our stay. I would strongly recommend that North Square be removed from the list of choices. It was completely unacceptable. I have been to far nicer restaurants during this promotion and been treated much, much better.",

            "analysis": "I classify this review as 'Negative'.\n\nThe reason for my classification is the strong negative language used by the reviewer to describe their experience at North Square. The reviewer specifically mentions being treated poorly and feeling as if they were \"less important\" than regular menu diners. They also describe the hostess as rude and condescending, which further adds to the negative sentiment. The reviewer explicitly states that they would not recommend North Square and that it is \"completely unacceptable\". The 1-star rating also reinforces the negative sentiment."
